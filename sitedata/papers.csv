NF refers to the recent class of methods for the neural representation of complex 3D scenes that has seen widespread success and application across computer vision. CURE represents the video as a continuous function parameterized by a coordinate-based neural network, whose inputs are the spatiotemporal coordinates and outputs are the corresponding RGB values. CURE introduces a new architecture that conditions the neural network on the input frames for imposing space-time consistency in the synthesized video. This not only improves the final interpolation quality, but also enables CURE to learn a prior across multiple videos.

However, typical assumptions on the factorization or independence  of the latent variables can substantially restrict its capacity for inference and generative modeling. A major line of active research aims at building more expressive variational models by designing deep hierarchies of interdependent latent variables. Although these models exhibit superior performance and enable richer latent representations, we show that they incur diminishing returns: adding more stochastic layers to an already very deep model yields small predictive improvement while substantially increasing the inference and training time. Moreover, the architecture for this class of models favors local interactions among the latent variables between neighboring layers when designing the conditioning factors of the involved distributions. This is the first work that proposes attention mechanisms to build more expressive variational distributions in deep probabilistic models by explicitly modeling both local and global interactions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose deep attentive variational autoencoder and test it on a variety of established datasets.

We demonstrate that applying traditional CP decomposition -- that factorizes tensors into rank-one components with compact vectors -- in our framework leads to improvements over vanilla NeRF. To further boost performance, we introduce a novel vector-matrix (VM) decomposition that relaxes the low-rank constraints for two modes of a tensor and factorizes tensors into compact vector and matrix factors. Beyond superior rendering quality, our models with CP and VM decompositions lead to a significantly lower memory footprint in comparison to previous and concurrent works that directly optimize per-voxel features. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TensoRF with CP decomposition achieves fast reconstruction (<30 min) with better rendering quality and even a smaller model size (<4 MB) compared to NeRF.

We introduce a framework for learning to estimate 4D visual representations from monocular RGB-D, which is able to persist objects, even once they become obstructed by occlusions. Unlike traditional video representations, we encode point clouds into a continuous representation, which permits the model to attend across the spatiotemporal context to resolve occlusions. On two large video datasets that we release along with this paper, our experiments show that the representation is able to successfully reveal occlusions for several tasks, without any architectural changes.

Our framework represents a wave propagation model generating continuous arrival time to find path solutions informed by a nonlinear first-order PDE called Eikonal Equation. We evaluate our method in various cluttered 3D environments, including the Gibson dataset, and demonstrate its ability to solve motion planning problems for 4-DOF and 6-DOF robot manipulators where the traditional grid-based Eikonal planners often face the curse of dimensionality.

This allows us to model complex vascular structures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight, and easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the potential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface.

We propose a different paradigm, where no deep features and no NeRF-like volume rendering are needed. Our method is capable of predicting the color of a target ray in a novel scene directly, just from a collection of patches sampled from the scene. We first leverage epipolar geometry to extract patches along the epipolar lines of each reference view. Each patch is linearly projected into a 1D feature vector and a sequence of transformers process the collection. For positional encoding, we parameterize rays as in a light field representation, with the crucial difference that the coordinates are canonicalized with respect to the target ray, which makes our method independent of the reference frame and improves generalization.

In this work, we propose to structure neural networks with two neural implicit representations, which are learned dynamically during each episode and map the content of the scene: (i) the Semantic Finder predicts the position of a previously seen queried object; (ii) the Occupancy and Exploration Implicit Representation encapsulates information about explored area and obstacles, and is queried with a novel global read mechanism which directly maps from function space to a usable embedding space.

While these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model and understand, these representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy, memory-usage, or adaptivity. In this work, we explore implicit neural representation as an alternative spatial discretization, where spatial information is implicitly stored in the neural network weights. With implicit neural spatial representation, PDE-constrained time-stepping translates into updating neural network weights, which naturally integrates with commonly adopted optimization time integrators.

Image distortions in NEDs can destroy the reality of the virtual object and cause sickness. To achieve distortion-free images in NEDs, it is necessary to establish a pixel-by-pixel correspondence between the viewpoint and the displayed image. Designing compact and wide-FoV NEDs requires complex optical designs. In such designs, the displayed images are subject to gaze-contingent, non-linear geometric distortions, which explicit geometric models can be difficult to represent or computationally intensive to optimize.  To solve these problems, we propose Neural Distortion Field (NDF), a fully-connected deep neural network that implicitly represents display surfaces complexly distorted in spaces. NDF takes spatial position and gaze direction as input and outputs the display pixel coordinate and its intensity as perceived in the input gaze direction. We synthesize the distortion map from a novel viewpoint by querying points on the ray from the viewpoint and computing a weighted sum to project output display coordinates into an image. Experiments showed that NDF calibrates an augmented reality NED with 90$^{\circ}$ FoV with about 3.23 pixel (5.8 arcmin) median error using only 8 training viewpoints. Additionally, we confirmed that NDF calibrates more accurately than the non-linear polynomial fitting, especially around the center of the FoV.",,,,Yes (almost done),,Opt. Exp. 2022,

A multi-distance interpolation method is proposed and applied on voxel features to model both small and large motions.

In this work, we observe that prior knowledge about the human body's shape and kinematic structure can be leveraged to improve generalization and efficiency. We decompose the full-body geometry into local body parts and employ a part-aware encoder-decoder architecture to learn neural articulated occupancy that models complex deformations locally. Our local shape encoder represents the body deformation of not only the corresponding body part but also the neighboring body parts. The decoder incorporates the geometric constraints of local body shape which significantly improves pose generalization. We demonstrate that our model is suitable for resolving self-intersections and collisions with 3D environments.

Recent progress in representing scene properties as coordinate-based neural networks have facilitated neural inverse rendering resulting in impressive geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Our key insight is that polarization is a useful cue for neural inverse rendering as polarization strongly depends on surface normals and is distinct for diffuse and specular reflectance. With the advent of commodity, on-chip, polarization sensors, capturing polarization has become practical. Thus, we propose PANDORA, a polarimetric inverse rendering approach based on implicit neural representations. From multi-view polarization images of an object, PANDORA jointly extracts the object's 3D geometry, separates the outgoing radiance into diffuse and specular and estimates the illumination incident on the object.

Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts.

Our central idea is to factorize the 4D scene tensor into multiple compact low-rank tensor components. We demonstrate that applying traditional CP decomposition -- that factorizes tensors into rank-one components with compact vectors -- in our framework leads to improvements over vanilla NeRF. To further boost performance, we introduce a novel vector-matrix (VM) decomposition that relaxes the low-rank constraints for two modes of a tensor and factorizes tensors into compact vector and matrix factors. Beyond superior rendering quality, our models with CP and VM decompositions lead to a significantly lower memory footprint in comparison to previous and concurrent works that directly optimize per-voxel features. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TensoRF with CP decomposition achieves fast reconstruction (<30 min) with better rendering quality and even a smaller model size (<4 MB) compared to NeRF. Moreover, TensoRF with VM decomposition further boosts rendering quality and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, while reducing the reconstruction time (<10 min) and retaining a compact model size (<75 MB).",,,,Yes (almost done),,ECCV 2022,

While traditional shape-from-shadow (SfS) algorithms reconstruct geometry from shadows, they assume a fixed scanning setup and fail to generalize to complex scenes. Neural rendering algorithms, on the other hand, rely on photometric consistency between RGB images, but largely ignore physical cues such as shadows, which have been shown to provide valuable information about the scene. We observe that shadows are a powerful cue that can constrain neural scene representations to learn SfS, and even outperform NeRF to reconstruct otherwise hidden geometry. We propose a graphics-inspired differentiable approach to render accurate shadows with volumetric rendering, predicting a shadow map that can be compared to the ground truth shadow. Even with just binary shadow maps, we show that neural rendering can localize the object and estimate coarse geometry. Our approach reveals that sparse cues in images can be used to estimate geometry using differentiable volumetric rendering. Moreover, our framework is highly generalizable and can work alongside existing 3D reconstruction techniques that otherwise only use photometric consistency.",,,,Yes (almost done),,ECCV 2022,

We present ShAPO, a method for joint multi-object detection, 3D textured reconstruction, 6D object pose and size estimation. Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape, appearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance, which is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel disentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed objects in their respective shape and appearance space. We also propose a novel, octree-based differentiable optimization step, allowing us to further improve object shape, pose and appearance simultaneously under the learned latent space, in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Our novel joint implicit textured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct novel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method, trained on simulated indoor scenes, accurately regresses the shape, appearance and pose of novel objects in the real-world with minimal fine-tuning.

VMRF introduces a view matching scheme, which exploits unbalanced optimal transport to produce a feature transport plan for mapping a rendered image with randomly initialized camera pose to the corresponding real image. With the feature transport plan as the guidance, a novel pose calibration technique is designed which rectifies the initially randomized camera poses by predicting relative pose transformations between the pair of rendered and real images.

Black",xiu2022icon,337,,"Current methods for learning realistic and animatable 3D clothed avatars need either posed 3D scans or 2D images with carefully controlled user poses. In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (""Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals""), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping.

Often, real-world collections of shapes have symmetries, which can be defined as transformations that do not change the essence of the shape. A natural way to incorporate symmetries in shape space learning is to ask that the mapping to the shape space (encoder) and mapping from the shape space (decoder) are equivariant to the relevant symmetries.  In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating equivariance in encoders and decoders by introducing two contributions: (i) adapting the recent Frame Averaging (FA) framework for building generic, efficient, and maximally expressive Equivariant autoencoders; and (ii) constructing autoencoders equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to different parts of the shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully piecewise Euclidean equivariant autoencoder construction. Training our framework is simple: it uses standard reconstruction losses and does not require the introduction of new losses. Our architectures are built of standard (backbone) architectures with the appropriate frame averaging to make them equivariant. Testing our framework on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neural representations, and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural networks show state-of-the-art generalization to unseen test shapes, improving relevant baselines by a large margin.

In this paper, we introduce SALD: a method for learning implicit neural representations of shapes directly from raw data. We generalize sign agnostic learning (SAL) to include derivatives: given an unsigned distance function to the input raw data, we advocate a novel sign agnostic regression loss, incorporating both pointwise values and gradients of the unsigned distance function. Optimizing this loss leads to a signed implicit function solution, the zero level set of which is a high-quality and valid manifold approximation to the input 3D data. The motivation behind SALD is that incorporating derivatives in a regression loss leads to a lower sample complexity, and consequently better fitting. In addition, we prove that SAL enjoys a minimal length property in 2D, favoring minimal length solutions. More importantly, we are able to show that this property still holds for SALD, i.e., with derivatives included.
We demonstrate the efficacy of SALD for shape space learning on two challenging datasets: ShapeNet which contains inconsistent orientation and non-manifold meshes, and D-Faust which contains raw 3D scans (triangle soups).

This architecture, in particular, allows sophisticated occlusion reasoning, gathering information from consistent source views.

Our framework contains two DNNs: a localization network that estimates the poses for input point clouds, and a map network that models the scene structure by estimating the occupancy status of global coordinates.

In this work, we investigate common issues with existing spatial encodings and propose a simple yet highly effective approach to modeling high-fidelity volumetric humans from sparse views.

This structure allows INRs to express signals with an exponentially increasing frequency support using a number of parameters that only grows linearly with depth. We also explore the inductive bias of INRs exploiting recent results about the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK). Specifically, we show that the eigenfunctions of the NTK can be seen as dictionary atoms whose inner product with the target signal determines the final performance of their reconstruction. In this regard, we reveal that meta-learning has a reshaping effect on the NTK analogous to dictionary learning, building dictionary atoms as a combination of the examples seen during meta-training.

Neural approaches such as NeRF have achieved photorealistic results on novel view synthesis, but they require known camera poses. Solving this problem with unknown camera poses is highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and illumination).

To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and compute latent vectors at each input point.

Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g. textured meshes, or implicit representations, e.g. radiance fields, and often requires input images with precise camera poses and long processing times for each novel scene.  In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method which processes posed or unposed RGB images of a new area, infers a ""set-latent scene representation"", and synthesises novel views, all in a single feed-forward pass. To calculate the scene representation, we propose a generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene representation to render novel views. Learning is supervised end-to-end by minimizing a novel-view reconstruction error.  We show that this method outperforms recent baselines in terms of PSNR and speed on synthetic datasets, including a new dataset created for the paper.

Although autoregressive models are naturally capable of handling dynamics, it is non-trivial to apply them to implicit representations, as explicit state decoding is infeasible due to prohibitive memory requirements. In this work, for the first time, we enable autoregressive modeling of implicit avatars. To reduce the memory bottleneck and efficiently model dynamic implicit surfaces, we introduce the notion of articulated observer points, which relate implicit states to the explicit surface of a parametric human body model. We demonstrate that encoding implicit surfaces as a set of height fields defined on articulated observer points leads to significantly better generalization compared to a latent representation.

These methods, which we call neural fields, have seen successful application in the synthesis of 3D shapes and image, animation of human bodies, 3D reconstruction, and pose estimation. However, due to rapid progress in a short time, many papers exist but a comprehensive review and formulation of the problem has not yet emerged. In this report, we address this limitation by providing context, mathematical grounding, and an extensive review of literature on neural fields. This report covers research along two dimensions. In Part I, we focus on techniques in neural fields by identifying common components of neural field methods, including different representations, architectures, forward mapping, and generalization methods. In Part II, we focus on applications of neural fields to different problems in visual computing, and beyond (e.g., robotics, audio). Our review shows the breadth of topics already covered in visual computing, both historically and in current incarnations, demonstrating the improved quality, flexibility, and capability brought by neural fields methods.

However, the underlying signal represented by these measurements is often continuous, e.g. the scene depicted in an image. A powerful continuous alternative is then to represent these measurements using an implicit neural representation, a neural function trained to output the appropriate measurement value for any input spatial location. In this paper, we take this idea to its next level: what would it take to perform deep learning on these functions instead, treating them as data? In this context we refer to the data as functa, and propose a framework for deep learning on functa. This view presents a number of challenges around efficient conversion from data to functa, compact representation of functa, and effectively solving downstream tasks on functa. We outline a recipe to overcome these challenges and apply it to a wide range of data modalities including images, 3D shapes, neural radiance fields (NeRF) and data on manifolds. We demonstrate that this approach has various compelling properties across data modalities, in particular on the canonical tasks of generative modeling, data imputation, novel view synthesis and classification.",,,,Yes (almost done),,ARXIV 2022,

The core approach is to render individual rays by querying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density and colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the rendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a common solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.  In this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine approach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the task at hand. We introduce a differentiable module that learns to propose samples and their importance for the fine network, and consider and compare multiple alternatives for its neural architecture. Training the proposal module from scratch can be unstable due to lack of supervision, so an effective pre-training strategy is also put forward. The approach, named `NeRF in detail' (NeRF-ID), achieves superior view synthesis quality over NeRF and the state-of-the-art on the synthetic Blender benchmark and on par or better performance on the real LLFF-NeRF scenes.

It is also the most significant bottleneck on physically based simulations and it easily becomes intractable as the number of vertices in the scene increases. Brute force approaches carry a quadratic growth in both computational time and memory footprint. While their parallelization is trivial in GPUs, their complexity discourages from using such approaches. Acceleration structures -- such as BVH -- are often applied to increase performance, achieving logarithmic computational times for individual point queries. Nonetheless, their memory footprint also grows rapidly and their parallelization in a GPU is problematic due to their branching nature. We propose using implicit surface representations learnt through deep learning for collision handling in physically based simulations. Our proposed architecture has a complexity of O(n) -- or O(1) for a single point query -- and has no parallelization issues.

We procure the surface orientation using a photometric stereo (PS) image formation model and blend it with a multi-view neural radiance field representation to recover the object's surface geometry. Contrary to the previous multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth contours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then fused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs neural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated by a deep photometric stereo network. We render the MVPS images by considering the object's surface normals for each 3D sample point along the viewing direction rather than explicitly using the density gradient in the volume space via 3D occupancy information. We optimize the proposed neural radiance field representation for the MVPS setup efficiently using a fully connected deep network to recover the 3D geometry of an object.

Such works are fundamentally based on a (implicit) volumetric representation of occupancy, allowing them to model diverse scene structure including translucent objects and atmospheric obscurants. But because the vast majority of real-world scenes are composed of well-defined surfaces, we introduce a surface analog of such implicit models called Neural Reflectance Surfaces (NeRS). NeRS learns a neural shape representation of a closed surface that is diffeomorphic to a sphere, guaranteeing water-tight reconstructions. Even more importantly, surface parameterizations allow NeRS to learn (neural) bidirectional surface reflectance functions (BRDFs) that factorize view-dependent appearance into environmental illumination, diffuse color (albedo), and specular ""shininess."" Finally, rather than illustrating our results on synthetic scenes or controlled in-the-lab capture, we assemble a novel dataset of multi-view images from online marketplaces for selling goods. Such ""in-the-wild"" multi-view image sets pose a number of challenges, including a small number of views with unknown/rough camera estimates. We demonstrate that surface-based neural reconstructions enable learning from such data, outperforming volumetric neural rendering-based reconstructions.

Some of their advantages are a sound theoretic foundation and an easy implementation in current deep learning frameworks. While neural fields have been applied to signals on manifolds, e.g., for texture reconstruction, their representation has been limited to extrinsically embedding the shape into Euclidean space. The extrinsic embedding ignores known intrinsic manifold properties and is inflexible wrt. transfer of the learned function. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces intrinsic neural fields, a novel and versatile representation for neural fields on manifolds. Intrinsic neural fields combine the advantages of neural fields with the spectral properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We show theoretically that intrinsic neural fields inherit many desirable properties of the extrinsic neural field framework but exhibit additional intrinsic qualities, like isometry invariance. In experiments, we show intrinsic neural fields can reconstruct high-fidelity textures from images with state-of-the-art quality and are robust to the discretization of the underlying manifold.

Thus, smoothness with respect to this descriptor is paramount for performing shape-editing operations. In this work, we introduce a novel regularization designed to encourage smooth latent spaces in neural fields by penalizing the upper bound on the field's Lipschitz constant.

Although these representations are easy to fit, it is not clear how to best evaluate geometric queries on the shape, such as intersecting against a ray or finding a closest point. The predominant approach is to encourage the network to have a signed distance property. However, this property typically holds only approximately, leading to robustness issues, and holds only at the conclusion of training, inhibiting the use of queries in loss functions. Instead, this work presents a new approach to perform queries directly on general neural implicit functions for a wide range of existing architectures. Our key tool is the application of range analysis to neural networks, using automatic arithmetic rules to bound the output of a network over a region; we conduct a study of range analysis on neural networks, and identify variants of affine arithmetic which are highly effective. We use the resulting bounds to develop geometric queries including ray casting, intersection testing, constructing spatial hierarchies, fast mesh extraction, closest-point evaluation, evaluating bulk properties, and more.

In this work, we think of videos of what they should be - time-continuous signals, and extend the paradigm of neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. For this, we first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional embeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image and video discriminators pair and propose to use a single hypernetwork-based one. This decreases the training cost and provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train directly on 1024$^2$ videos for the first time. We build our model on top of StyleGAN2 and it is just 5% more expensive to train at the same resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64 frames at a fixed rate. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on four modern 256$^2$ video synthesis benchmarks and one 1024$^2$ resolution one.

In contrast to the single object scenes against which NeRFs have been traditionally evaluated, this setting poses multiple challenges including (1) the need to incorporate thousands of images with varying lighting conditions, all of which capture only a small subset of the scene, (2) prohibitively high model capacity and ray sampling requirements beyond what can be naively trained on a single GPU, and (3) an arbitrarily large number of possible viewpoints that make it unfeasible to precompute all relevant information beforehand (as real-time NeRF renderers typically do). To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for large-scale scenes, motivating a sparse network structure where parameters are specialized to different regions of the scene. We introduce a simple geometric clustering algorithm that partitions training images (or rather pixels) into different NeRF submodules that can be trained in parallel. We evaluate our approach across scenes taken from the Quad 6k and UrbanScene3D datasets as well as against our own drone footage and show a 3x training speedup while improving PSNR by over 11% on average. We subsequently perform an empirical evaluation of recent NeRF fast renderers on top of Mega-NeRF and introduce a novel method that exploits temporal coherence.

Recent works have shown promising results by training neural radiance field (NeRF) generators on unstructured 2D images, but still can not generate highly-realistic images with fine details. A critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit surfaces in the 3D volume.

The wide span of camera distance to the scene yields multi-scale data with different levels of detail and spatial coverage, which casts great challenges to vanilla NeRF and biases it towards compromised results. To address these issues, we introduce CityNeRF, a progressive learning paradigm that grows the NeRF model and training set synchronously. Starting from fitting distant views with a shallow base block, as training progresses, new blocks are appended to accommodate the emerging details in the increasingly closer views.

Our technique achieves state-of-the-art results when reconstructing 3D objects and large scenes from sparse oriented points, and can reconstruct shape categories outside the training set with almost no drop in accuracy. The core insight of our approach is that kernel methods are extremely effective for reconstructing shapes when the chosen kernel has an appropriate inductive bias. We thus factor the problem of shape reconstruction into two parts: (1) a backbone neural network which learns kernel parameters from data, and (2) a kernel ridge regression that fits the input points on-the-fly by solving a simple positive definite linear system using the learned kernel. As a result of this factorization, our reconstruction gains the benefits of data-driven methods under sparse point density while maintaining interpolatory behavior, which converges to the ground truth shape as input sampling density increases. Our experiments demonstrate a strong generalization capability to objects outside the train-set category and scanned scenes.

Given its simplicity and high quality rendering, many NeRF applications are being developed. However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow speed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference, including intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated data structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this work, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic techniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF), integrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only requiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull, which can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field separation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We provide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF codebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular visual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the highly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering quality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF training from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of a classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can empower and accelerate new NeRF extensions and applications, with its simplicity, portability, and reliable performance gains.

These ""self-models"" allow robots to consider outcomes of multiple possible future actions, without trying them out in physical reality. Recent progress in fully data-driven self-modeling has enabled machines to learn their own forward kinematics directly from task-agnostic interaction data. However, forward-kinema\-tics models can only predict limited aspects of the morphology, such as the position of end effectors or velocity of joints and masses. A key challenge is to model the entire morphology and kinematics, without prior knowledge of what aspects of the morphology will be relevant to future tasks. Here, we propose that instead of directly modeling forward-kinematics, a more useful form of self-modeling is one that could answer space occupancy queries, conditioned on the robot's state. Such query-driven self models are continuous in the spatial domain, memory efficient, fully differentiable and kinematic aware. In physical experiments, we demonstrate how a visual self-model is accurate to about one percent of the workspace, enabling the robot to perform various motion planning and control tasks. Visual self-modeling can also allow the robot to detect, localize and recover from real-world damage, leading to improved machine resiliency.

Traditionally, synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g., from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint synthesis of a captured scene.

Neural fields can compactly store complicated shapes without spatial discretization. Moreover, neural fields are infinitely differentiable, which allows them to be optimized for objectives that involve higher-order derivatives. This raises the question: can geometry processing be done entirely using neural fields? We introduce loss functions and architectures to show that some of the most challenging geometry processing tasks, such as deformation and filtering, can be done with neural fields.

The cumulative rendering process in radiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since gradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object surfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy representations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we directly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training they will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and eventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose Generative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance fields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training convergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the cumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface points as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF combines the merits of two representations in a unified framework. In practice, the training-time transition of start from radiance fields and march to occupancy representations is achieved in GOF by gradually shrinking the sampling region in its rendering process from the entire volume to a minimal neighboring region around the surface. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that GOF can synthesize high-quality images with 3D consistency and simultaneously learn compact and smooth object surfaces.

Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images. Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed approach achieves photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis while capturing accurate underlying 3D shapes.

Being capable of conveying fine details in a high dimensional signal, unboundedly of its domain, implicit neural representations ensure many advantages over conventional discrete representations. However, the current approach is difficult to scale for a large number of signals or a data set, since learning a neural representation -- which is parameter heavy by itself -- for each signal individually requires a lot of memory and computations. To address this issue, we propose to leverage a meta-learning approach in combination with network compression under a sparsity constraint, such that it renders a well-initialized sparse parameterization that evolves quickly to represent a set of unseen signals in the subsequent training.

Our model is the first grid-free, encoder-based approach that locally describes an implicit function. The vector attention mechanism from [Zhao et al. 2020] serves as main point cloud processing module, and allows for permutation invariance and translation equivariance.

To address these issues, StyleNeRF integrates the neural radiance field (NeRF) into a style-based generator to tackle the aforementioned challenges, i.e., improving rendering efficiency and 3D consistency for high-resolution image generation. To address the first issue, we perform volume rendering only to produce a low-resolution feature map, and progressively apply upsampling in 2D. To mitigate the inconsistencies caused by 2D upsampling, we propose multiple designs including a better upsampler choice and a new regularization loss to enforce 3D consistency. With these designs, StyleNeRF is able to synthesize high-resolution images at interactive rates while preserving 3D consistency at high quality. StyleNeRF also enables control of camera poses and different levels of styles, which can generalize to unseen views. It also supports challenging tasks such as style mixing, inversion and simple semantic edits.",,,,,,OpenReview 2021,

NeRFs represent continuous volumetric density and RGB values in a neural network, and generate photo-realistic images from unseen camera viewpoints through ray tracing. We propose an algorithm for navigating a robot through a 3D environment represented as a NeRF using only an on-board RGB camera for localization. We assume the NeRF for the scene has been pre-trained offline, and the robot's objective is to navigate through unoccupied space in the NeRF to reach a goal pose. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is amenable to constraining the robot's full pose and control inputs. We also introduce an optimization based filtering method to estimate 6DoF pose and velocities for the robot in the NeRF given only an onboard RGB camera. We combine the trajectory planner with the pose filter in an online replanning loop to give a vision-based robot navigation pipeline. We present simulation results with a quadrotor robot navigating through a jungle gym environment, the inside of a church, and Stonehenge using only an RGB camera. We also demonstrate an omnidirectional ground robot navigating through the church, requiring it to reorient to fit through the narrow gap.

We replace these priors with measurements from a time-of-flight (ToF) camera, and introduce a neural representation based on an image formation model for continuous-wave ToF cameras. Instead of working with processed depth maps, we model the raw ToF sensor measurements to improve reconstruction quality and avoid issues with low reflectance regions, multi-path interference, and a sensor's limited unambiguous depth range.

The technique approximates the $\textit{kinematics}$ by approximating the deformation map in a manner that restricts deformation trajectories to reside on a low-dimensional manifold expressed from the extrinsic view via a parameterization function. By explicitly approximating the deformation map and its spatial-temporal gradients, the deformation gradient and the velocity can be computed simply by differentiating the associated parameterization function. Unlike classical model reduction techniques that build a subspace for a finite number of degrees of freedom, the proposed method approximates the entire deformation map with infinite degrees of freedom. Therefore, the technique supports resolution changes in the reduced simulation, attaining the challenging task of zero-shot super-resolution by generating material points unseen in the training data. The ability to generate material points also allows for adaptive quadrature rules for stress update. A family of projection methods is devised to generate $\textit{dynamics}$, i.e., at every time step, the methods perform three steps: (1) generate quadratures in the full space from the reduced space, (2) compute position and velocity updates in the full space, and (3) perform a least-squares projection of the updated position and velocity onto the low-dimensional manifold and its tangent space. Computational speedup is achieved via hyper-reduction, i.e., only a subset of the original material points are needed for dynamics update. Large-scale numerical examples with millions of material points illustrate the method's ability to gain an order-of-magnitude computational-cost saving -- indeed $\textit{real-time simulations}$ in some cases -- with negligible errors.",,,,"Yes (No need to fill out ""Date"", ""Authors"", ""Abstract"", ""Bibtex Citation"")",New entry,ARXIV 2021,

Importantly, we design our atlases to be interpretable and semantic, which facilitates easy and intuitive editing in the atlas domain, with minimal manual work required. Edits applied to a single 2D atlas (or input video frame) are automatically and consistently mapped back to the original video frames, while preserving occlusions, deformation, and other complex scene effects such as shadows and reflections.

Recently, Extended PINNs (XPINNs) based on domain decomposition methods have attracted considerable attention due to their effectiveness in modeling multiscale and multiphysics problems and their parallelization. However, theoretical understanding on their convergence and generalization properties remains unexplored. In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how and when XPINNs outperform PINNs. Specifically, for general multi-layer PINNs and XPINNs, we first provide a prior generalization bound via the complexity of the target functions in the PDE problem, and a posterior generalization bound via the posterior matrix norms of the networks after optimization. Moreover, based on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve generalization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of XPINN, namely the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for generalization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into several simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part and boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less training data being available in each subdomain, and hence such model is typically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable. Empirically, we choose five PDEs to show when XPINNs perform better than, similar to, or worse than PINNs, hence demonstrating and justifying our new theory.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

Adopting such generalization approaches to humans, however, is highly challenging due to the heavy occlusions and dynamic articulations of body parts. To tackle this, we propose Neural Human Performer, a novel approach that learns generalizable neural radiance fields based on a parametric human body model for robust performance capture. Specifically, we first introduce a temporal transformer that aggregates tracked visual features based on the skeletal body motion over time. Moreover, a multi-view transformer is proposed to perform cross-attention between the temporally-fused features and the pixel-aligned features at each time step to integrate observations on the fly from multiple views.

NEAT is a continuous function which maps locations in Bird's Eye View (BEV) scene coordinates to waypoints and semantics, using intermediate attention maps to iteratively compress high-dimensional 2D image features into a compact representation. This allows our model to selectively attend to relevant regions in the input while ignoring information irrelevant to the driving task, effectively associating the images with the BEV representation. In a new evaluation setting involving adverse environmental conditions and challenging scenarios, NEAT outperforms several strong baselines and achieves driving scores on par with the privileged CARLA expert used to generate its training data.

However, in downstream applications where decisions need to be made based on automatic predictions, it is critical to leverage the confidence associated with the model estimations. Whereas uncertainty quantification is a long-standing problem in Machine Learning, it has been largely overlooked in the recent NeRF literature. In this context, we propose Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields (S-NeRF), a generalization of standard NeRF that learns a probability distribution over all the possible radiance fields modeling the scene. This distribution allows to quantify the uncertainty associated with the scene information provided by the model. S-NeRF optimization is posed as a Bayesian learning problem which is efficiently addressed using the Variational Inference framework. Exhaustive experiments over benchmark datasets demonstrate that S-NeRF is able to provide more reliable predictions and confidence values than generic approaches previously proposed for uncertainty estimation in other domains.",,,Direct,,,ARXIV 2021,

To survive the training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn sharp boundaries for each object.

Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors.

Given a sequence of scans of a subject in various poses, we learn to animate the character for new poses. Existing methods have relied on template-based representations of the human body (or clothing). However such models usually have fixed and limited resolutions, require difficult data pre-processing steps and cannot be used with complex clothing. We draw inspiration from template-based methods, which factorize motion into articulation and non-rigid deformation, but generalize this concept for implicit shape learning to obtain a more flexible model. We learn to map every point in the space to a canonical space, where a learned deformation field is applied to model non-rigid effects, before evaluating the signed distance field. Our formulation allows the learning of complex and non-rigid deformations of clothing and soft tissue, without computing a template registration as it is common with current approaches. Neural-GIF can be trained on raw 3D scans and reconstructs detailed complex surface geometry and deformations. Moreover, the model can generalize to new poses.

So far, the focus has been shape reconstruction, while shape generalization was mostly left to generic encoder-decoder or auto-decoder regularization. In this paper we advocate deformation-aware regularization for implicit neural representations, aiming at producing plausible deformations as latent code changes. The challenge is that implicit representations do not capture correspondences between different shapes, which makes it difficult to represent and regularize their deformations. Thus, we propose to pair the implicit representation of the shapes with an explicit, piecewise linear deformation field, learned as an auxiliary function. We demonstrate that, by regularizing these deformation fields, we can encourage the implicit neural representation to induce natural deformations in the learned shape space, such as as-rigid-as-possible deformations.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

The effectiveness of these techniques is, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of input views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase. Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art 3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric methods when large sets of views are available.",,,Direct,,,ARXIV 2021,

Similar to deep SDF models, our SDDF formulation can represent whole categories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partial input data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface in any direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allows training an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance measurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our model also removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering by directly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions. Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which train high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction the property that SDDF values decrease linearly along the viewing direction.

Compared to classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their ability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their ability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation problem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have struggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains and/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world application. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue, including the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem as the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this work we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to differential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are inspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the differential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis functions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn these basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains. FBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using separate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of the underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a parallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that FBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems, outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources required, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large, real-world problems.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

In this study, we propose a semi-case-wise learning-based method named Weight Encode Reconstruction Network (WERNet) to co-learn the target phantom intensities and the adaptive weight matrix of the case without labeling the target voxel set and thus offers a more applicable solution for computed tomography problems. Both numerical and experimental validations were conducted to evaluate the algorithm. In the numerical test, with the help of gradient normalization, the WERNet reconstructed voxel set with a high accuracy and showed a higher capability of denoising compared to the classic ART methods. In the experimental test, WERNet produces comparable results to the ART method while having a better performance in avoiding the streaks. Furthermore, with the adaptive weight matrix, WERNet is not sensitive to the ensemble intensity of the projection which shows much better robustness than ART method.",Yes,,,,,Optics Express 2021,

Our model combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and time contrastive learning with an autoencoding framework, which learns viewpoint-invariant 3D-aware scene representations. We show that a dynamics model, constructed over the learned representation space, enables visuomotor control for challenging manipulation tasks involving both rigid bodies and fluids, where the target is specified in a viewpoint different from what the robot operates on. When coupled with an auto-decoding framework, it can even support goal specification from camera viewpoints that are outside the training distribution. We further demonstrate the richness of the learned 3D dynamics model by performing future prediction and novel view synthesis.

We propose DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning neural radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to regularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering novel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ``free"" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss to ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is close to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate images given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two training views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as well as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with these NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal.

Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a unique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image feature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural shape and image feature priors which accelerate training.

To compensate for inaccurate pose estimation, we introduce the pose refinement strategy that updates the initial pose during the learning process, which not only helps to learn more accurate human reconstruction but also accelerates the convergence.

A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through this ""hyper-space"". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between ""moments"", i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as measured by LPIPS.",,,Direct,,,ARXIV 2021,

Since pretraining neural networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization via adaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead -- about 2.6ms on full HD resolution -- thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that fully exploits modern hardware.

So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as Laplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray. Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the two.",,,,,,NeurIPS 2021,

Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars, represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a Hypernetwork/Meta-learning that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The Hypernetwork/Meta-learning is conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes faster.

Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel view synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned implicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface constraints in the representation.

We observe that the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e. bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.",,,,,,IJCAI 2021,

Deep neural representations of 3D shapes as implicit functions have been shown to produce high fidelity models surpassing the resolution-memory trade-off faced by the explicit representations using meshes and point clouds. However, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned distance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a promising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since the gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate local (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes which are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics. There are additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a low-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such surfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest surface-point CSP representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent complex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also allows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties. We further demonstrate that it leads to efficient implementation of downstream algorithms like sphere-tracing for rendering the 3D surface as well as to create explicit mesh-based representations. Extensive experimental evaluation on the ShapeNet dataset validate the above contributions with results surpassing the state-of-the-art.

To this end, we introduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions on SO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural network that estimates the probability given the input image and a candidate pose. Grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the most likely pose, but it is also possible to evaluate the probability at any pose, enabling reasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way of representing distributions on manifolds, and to showcase the rich expressive power, we introduce a dataset of challenging symmetric and nearly-symmetric objects. We require no supervision on pose uncertainty -- the model trains only with a single pose per example. Nonetheless, our implicit model is highly expressive to handle complex distributions over 3D poses, while still obtaining accurate pose estimation on standard non-ambiguous environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3) benchmarks.",,,,,,ICML 2021,

In this paper, we introduce Neural Motion Consensus Flow (MoCo-Flow), a representation that models the dynamic scene using a 4D continuous time-variant function. The proposed representation is learned by an optimization which models a dynamic scene that minimizes the error of rendering all observation images. At the heart of our work lies a novel optimization formulation, which is constrained by a motion consensus regularization on the motion flow.

The differentiable PSR layer allows us to efficiently and differentiably bridge the explicit 3D point representation with the 3D mesh via the implicit indicator field, enabling end-to-end optimization of surface reconstruction metrics such as Chamfer distance. This duality between points and meshes hence allows us to represent shapes as oriented point clouds, which are explicit, lightweight and expressive. Compared to neural implicit representations, our Shape-As-Points (SAP) model is more interpretable, lightweight, and accelerates inference time by one order of magnitude.

In particular, the medial field encodes the local thickness of a 3D shape, and enables O(1) projection of a query point onto the medial axis. To construct the medial field we require nothing but the SDF of the shape itself, thus allowing its straightforward incorporation in any application that relies on signed distance fields. Working in unison with the O(1) surface projection supported by the SDF, the medial field opens the door for an entirely new set of efficient, shape-aware operations on implicit representations. We present three such applications, including a modification to sphere tracing that renders implicit representations with better convergence properties, a fast construction method for memory-efficient rigid-body collision proxies, and an efficient approximation of ambient occlusion that remains stable with respect to viewpoint variations.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

Rendering a ray from an LFN requires only a *single* network evaluation, as opposed to hundreds of evaluations per ray for ray-marching or volumetric based renderers in 3D-structured neural scene representations. In the setting of simple scenes, we leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity, and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as the Lumigraph.

This enables the rendering of novel views of the object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object's material properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural Radiance Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the object into a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry while solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting. Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, light visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simple smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDF measurements. By explicitly modeling light visibility, NeRFactor is able to separate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadows under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3D models for free-viewpoint relighting in this challenging and underconstrained capture setup for both synthetic and real scenes. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that NeRFactor outperforms classic and deep learning-based state of the art across various tasks.

To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose- and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.

Our framework consists of two components: an implicit representation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and a Hypernetwork/Meta-learning to transfer the style information into the scene representation. In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into the geometry and appearance branches, and the Hypernetwork/Meta-learning learns to predict the parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To alleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage training procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and content losses with the neural radiance field model.

The approach does not rely on the body shape information but, if available, can harness it. GeodesyNets learn a three-dimensional, differentiable, function representing the body density, which we call neural density field. The body shape, as well as other geodetic properties, can easily be recovered. We investigate six different shapes including the bodies 101955 Bennu, 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 433 Eros and 25143 Itokawa for which shape models developed during close proximity surveys are available. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous mass distributions are considered. The gravitational acceleration computed from the trained geodesyNets models, as well as the inferred body shape, show great accuracy in all cases with a relative error on the predicted acceleration smaller than 1\% even close to the asteroid surface. When the body shape information is available, geodesyNets can seamlessly exploit it and be trained to represent a high-fidelity neural density field able to give insights into the internal structure of the body.

However, the heavy computation required by its volumetric approach prevents NeRF from being useful in practice; minutes are taken to render a single image of a few megapixels. Now, an image of a scene can be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicated region of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while a small neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balance between efficiency and quality. Recursive-NeRF is our embodiment of this idea, providing an efficient and adaptive rendering and training approach for NeRF. The core of Recursive-NeRF learns uncertainties for query coordinates, representing the quality of the predicted color and volumetric intensity at each level. Only query coordinates with high uncertainties are forwarded to the next level to a bigger neural network with a more powerful representational capability. The final rendered image is a composition of results from neural networks of all levels.

However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixed and limited views, as some clinically useful information is represented only from a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a new concept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from any queried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that an underlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, and directions of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network (Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by using a sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes Electrocardio Panorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to better disentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a new Angular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose a self-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps model the electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very few modifications, Nef-Net can also synthesize ECG signals from scratch. Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panorama synthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG view transformation and ECG synthesis from scratch).

More recently, Generative Radiance Fields (GRAF) achieved full volumetric reconstruction of a scene from unposed images only, thanks to the use of an adversarial framework to train a NeRF. In this paper, we compare and evaluate the potential of NeRF and GRAF to render novel views and extract the 3D shape of two different spacecraft, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite of ESA's Living Planet Programme and a generic cube sat. Considering the best performances of both models, we observe that NeRF has the ability to render more accurate images regarding the material specularity of the spacecraft and its pose.

Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken from the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations, or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodes views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored. In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress 3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as neural radiance fields.

Some recent works have proposed to decompose a dynamic scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model.

Compared to traditional representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition, similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters, a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then, hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an order of magnitude.",,,,,,SIGGRAPH 2021,

Existing approaches for compressing 3D scenes are based on a separation of compression and rendering: each of the original views is compressed using traditional 2D image formats; the receiver decompresses the views and then performs the rendering. We unify these steps by directly compressing an implicit representation of the scene, a function that maps spatial coordinates to a radiance vector field, which can then be queried to render arbitrary viewpoints. The function is implemented as a neural network and jointly trained for reconstruction as well as compressibility, in an end-to-end manner, with the use of an entropy penalty on the parameters. Our method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art conventional approach for scene compression, achieving simultaneously higher quality reconstructions and lower bitrates.

To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism.

In contrast to traditional rendering pipelines, this prohibits changing surface reflectance, illumination, or composing other objects in the scene. In this work, we explicitly model the light transport between scene surfaces and we rely on traditional integration schemes and the rendering equation to reconstruct a scene. The proposed method allows BSDF recovery with unknown light conditions and classic light transports such as pathtracing. By learning decomposed transport with surface representations established in conventional rendering methods, the method naturally facilitates editing shape, reflectance, lighting and scene composition. The method outperforms NeRV for relighting under known lighting conditions, and produces realistic reconstructions for relit and edited scenes.

However, the computationally demanding nature of sampling-based MPC algorithms has been a key bottleneck in their application to high-dimensional robotic manipulation problems in the real world. Previous methods have addressed this issue by running MPC in the task space while relying on a low-level operational space controller for joint control. However, by not using the joint space of the robot in the MPC formulation, existing methods cannot directly account for non-task space related constraints such as avoiding joint limits, singular configurations, and link collisions. In this paper, we develop a system for fast, joint space sampling-based MPC for manipulators that is efficiently parallelized using GPUs. Our approach can handle task and joint space constraints while taking less than 8ms~(125Hz) to compute the next control command. Further, our method can tightly integrate perception into the control problem by utilizing learned cost functions from raw sensor data. We validate our approach by deploying it on a Franka Panda robot for a variety of dynamic manipulation tasks. We study the effect of different cost formulations and MPC parameters on the synthesized behavior and provide key insights that pave the way for the application of sampling-based MPC for manipulators in a principled manner. We also provide highly optimized, open-source code to be used by the wider robot learning and control community.

In this paper, we introduce a general framework built on top of what we call Vector Neuron representations for creating SO(3)-equivariant neural networks for pointcloud processing. Extending neurons from 1D scalars to 3D vectors, our vector neurons enable a simple mapping of SO(3) actions to latent spaces thereby providing a framework for building equivariance in common neural operations -- including linear layers, non-linearities, pooling, and normalizations. Due to their simplicity, vector neurons are versatile and, as we demonstrate, can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones, allowing them to process geometry inputs in arbitrary poses.

Existing 4D-CT reconstructions are designed for sparse sampling schemes that require fast CT scanners to capture multiple, rapid revolutions around the scene in order to generate high quality results. However, if the scene is moving too fast, then the sampling occurs along a limited view and is difficult to reconstruct due to spatiotemporal ambiguities. In this work, we design a reconstruction pipeline using implicit neural representations coupled with a novel parametric motion field warping to perform limited view 4D-CT reconstruction of rapidly deforming scenes. Importantly, we utilize a differentiable analysis-by-synthesis approach to compare with captured x-ray sinogram data in a self-supervised fashion. Thus, our resulting optimization method requires no training data to reconstruct the scene. We demonstrate that our proposed system robustly reconstructs scenes containing deformable and periodic motion and validate against state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we demonstrate an ability to reconstruct continuous spatiotemporal representations of our scenes and upsample them to arbitrary volumes and frame rates post-optimization.

For each scene, we train S-NeRF using very high spatial resolution optical images taken from known viewing angles. The learning requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky), we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared to NeRF. The S-NeRF methodology not only performs novel view synthesis and full 3D shape estimation, it also enables shadow detection, albedo synthesis, and transient object filtering, without any explicit shape supervision.",,,,,,CVPR 2021,

However, NeRF's estimated volume density does not admit accurate surface reconstruction. Our key insight is that implicit surface models and radiance fields can be formulated in a unified way, enabling both surface and volume rendering using the same model. This unified perspective enables novel, more efficient sampling procedures and the ability to reconstruct accurate surfaces without input masks.

Here, we present a parallel algorithm for cPINNs and XPINNs constructed with a hybrid programming model described by MPI $+$ X, where X $\in \{\text{CPUs},~\text{GPUs}\}$.

We compare the performance of distributed cPINNs and XPINNs for various forward problems, using both weak and strong scalings. Our results indicate that for space domain decomposition, cPINNs are more efficient in terms of communication cost but XPINNs provide greater flexibility as they can also handle time-domain decomposition for any differential equations, and can deal with any arbitrarily shaped complex subdomains.

Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and results in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses.",,,Direct,,,CVPR 2021,

In this work, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesis approach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires only sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired by classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by finding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and density for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the input images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10 sparse and spread-out views as input. We show that 10-15 minutes of fine-tuning further improve the results, achieving significantly sharper, more detailed results than scene-specific models.

Yet, extending these methods to learn neural models of human shape is still in its infancy. Human bodies are complex and the key challenge is to learn a representation that generalizes such that it can express body shape deformations for unseen subjects in unseen, highly-articulated, poses. To address this challenge, we introduce LEAP (LEarning Articulated occupancy of People), a novel neural occupancy representation of the human body. Given a set of bone transformations (i.e. joint locations and rotations) and a query point in space, LEAP first maps the query point to a canonical space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS) functions and then efficiently queries the occupancy value via an occupancy network that models accurate identity- and pose-dependent deformations in the canonical space. Experiments show that our canonicalized occupancy estimation with the learned LBS functions greatly improves the generalization capability of the learned occupancy representation across various human shapes and poses, outperforming existing solutions in all settings.",,,Direct,,,CVPR 2021,

In this paper, we propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses -- the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show that na\""ively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.",,,,,,ICCV 2021,

We demonstrate how depth measurements can be incorporated into the radiance field formulation to produce more detailed and complete reconstruction results than using methods based on either color or depth data alone. In contrast to a density field as the underlying geometry representation, we propose to learn a deep neural network which stores a truncated signed distance field. Using this representation, we show that one can still leverage differentiable volume rendering to estimate color values of the observed images during training to compute a reconstruction loss. This is beneficial for learning the signed distance field in regions with missing depth measurements. Furthermore, we correct misalignment errors of the camera, improving the overall reconstruction quality.

However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy.

We present a new representation that generalizes to multiple instances and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity. We use a dual-MLP architecture to encode the signals. A synthesis network creates a functional mapping from a low-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGB color). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the target signal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesis network. We also propose a local-functional representation which enables generalization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,with each tile represented by a latent code. At test time, the signal is encoded with high-fidelity by inferring (or directly optimizing) the latent code-book.

In formulating an implicit representation of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class.

These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without template-based surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar.

The experimental results in simulation and on the real robot have demonstrated that the use of implicit neural representations and joint learning of grasp affordance and 3D reconstruction have led to state-of-the-art grasping results. Our method outperforms baselines by over 10% in terms of grasp success rate. Additional results and videos can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/rpl-giga2021",,,,,,RSS 2021,

These vectors are used independently to condition a NeRF decoder, defining the geometry and appearance of each object. We make learning more computationally efficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputs without explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equal or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image, but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in that regard.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

However, the construction of these parametric models is often tedious, as it requires heavy manual tweaking, and they struggle to represent additional complexity and details such as wrinkles or clothing. To this end, we propose Neural Parametric Models (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D models, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints. In particular, we learn to disentangle 4D dynamics into latent-space representations of shape and pose, leveraging the flexibility of recent developments in learned implicit functions. Crucially, once learned, our neural parametric models of shape and pose enable optimization over the learned spaces to fit to new observations, similar to the fitting of a traditional parametric model, e.g., SMPL. This enables NPMs to achieve a significantly more accurate and detailed representation of observed deformable sequences. We show that NPMs improve notably over both parametric and non-parametric state of the art in reconstruction and tracking of monocular depth sequences of clothed humans and hands. Latent-space interpolation as well as shape/pose transfer experiments further demonstrate the usefulness of NPMs. Code is publicly available at https://pablopalafox.github.io/npms.",,,,,,ICCV 2021,

Key to our approach is a local implicit neural representation built on ray-voxel pairs that allows our method to generalize to unseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation, we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-D input.

Our model can be used as a prior to generate new scenes, or to complete a scene given only sparse 2D observations. Recent work has shown that generative models of radiance fields can capture properties such as multi-view consistency and view-dependent lighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing of single objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity of realistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representational capacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to larger and more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learned prior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantly different from observed viewpoints.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360{\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

For each scene, we take 3D coordinates (x, y, z) and 2D view-point orientations (I,, E,) as inputs. A set of fully-connected layers output volume density and RGB values at given 3D spatial positions. Then, we render the output volume density and RGB values along the camera rays into images using volume density rendering techniques. During training process, we optimize a continuous volume scene function with a small amount of input viewing directions. By designing versatile embedding module and multi-scene representation networks, our model can render photographic images with novel viewing directions for different complex scenes.

While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporating such a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera pose ranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution.

Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps do not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing hard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need. In this paper, we advocate considering neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with respect to distortion measures.

We extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to jointly encode semantics with appearance and geometry, so that complete and accurate 2D semantic labels can be achieved using a small amount of in-place annotations specific to the scene. The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF benefit semantics by enabling sparse labels to efficiently propagate. We show the benefit of this approach when labels are either sparse or very noisy in room-scale scenes. We demonstrate its advantageous properties in various interesting applications such as an efficient scene labelling tool, novel semantic view synthesis, label denoising, super-resolution, label interpolation and multi-view semantic label fusion in visual semantic mapping systems.",,,,,,ICCV 2021,

Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images, we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.",,,,,,ICCV 2021,

Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF.

The resulting scene representation retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent appearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can be rendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU).

Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150 FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities, we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions. Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems.

Alla Chaitanya, Anton Kaplanyan, Markus Steinberger",neff2021donerf,121,6,"The recent research explosion around implicit neural representations, such as NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality scene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF, our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on available ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration methods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require additional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and can render interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.",,,,,,EGSR 2021,

Our approach takes the high quality and compactness of static neural radiance fields in a new direction: to a model-free, dynamic setting. At the core of our approach is a novel time-conditioned neural radiance fields that represents scene dynamics using a set of compact latent codes. To exploit the fact that changes between adjacent frames of a video are typically small and locally consistent, we propose two novel strategies for efficient training of our neural network: 1) An efficient hierarchical training scheme, and 2) an importance sampling strategy that selects the next rays for training based on the temporal variation of the input videos. In combination, these two strategies significantly boost the training speed, lead to fast convergence of the training process, and enable high quality results. Our learned representation is highly compact and able to represent a 10 second 30 FPS multi-view video recording by 18 cameras with a model size of just 28MB. We demonstrate that our method can render high-fidelity wide-angle novel views at over 1K resolution, even for highly complex and dynamic scenes.

Instead, we present an approach that explicitly disentangles geometry--represented as a continuous 3D volume--from appearance--represented as a continuous 2D texture map. We achieve this by introducing a 3D-to-2D texture mapping (or surface parameterization) network into volumetric representations. We constrain this texture mapping network using an additional 2D-to-3D inverse mapping network and a novel cycle consistency loss to make 3D surface points map to 2D texture points that map back to the original 3D points. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using only multi-view image supervision and generates high-quality rendering results.

By drawing on source views at render time, our method hearkens back to classic work on image-based rendering (IBR), and allows us to render high-resolution imagery. Unlike neural scene representation work that optimizes per-scene functions for rendering, we learn a generic view interpolation function that generalizes to novel scenes. We render images using classic volume rendering, which is fully differentiable and allows us to train using only multi-view posed images as supervision. Experiments show that our method outperforms recent novel view synthesis methods that also seek to generalize to novel scenes.

Most prior works aim to exploit these benefits in order to solve PDE-governed forward problems, or associated inverse problems that are defined by a small number of parameters. In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach to tackle topology optimization (TO) problems. Topology optimization refers to an important class of inverse problems that typically feature very high-dimensional parameter spaces and objective landscapes which are highly non-linear. To effectively leverage neural representations in the context of TO problems, we use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize both density and displacement fields. Using sensitivity analysis with a moving mean squared error, we show that our formulation can be used to efficiently minimize traditional structural compliance objectives. As we show through our experiments, a major benefit of our approach is that it enables self-supervised learning of continuous solution spaces to topology optimization problems.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks to fit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape and appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can then render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even real photographs).

Among various NVS techniques, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently gained popularity due to its remarkable synthesis quality. Existing NeRF-based approaches assume that the camera parameters associated with each input image are either directly accessible at training, or can be accurately estimated with conventional techniques based on correspondences, such as Structure-from-Motion. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed NeRF--, for training NeRF models given only RGB images, without pre-computed camera parameters. Specifically, we show that the camera parameters, including both intrinsics and extrinsics, can be automatically discovered via joint optimisation during the training of the NeRF model. On the standard LLFF benchmark, our model achieves comparable novel view synthesis results compared to the baseline trained with COLMAP pre-computed camera parameters. We also conduct extensive analyses to understand the model behaviour under different camera trajectories, and show that in scenarios where COLMAP fails, our model still produces robust results.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

We present a compact neural network-based representation of BRDF data that combines high-accuracy reconstruction with efficient practical rendering via built-in interpolation of reflectance. We encode BRDFs as lightweight networks, and propose a training scheme with adaptive angular sampling, critical for the accurate reconstruction of specular highlights. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to make our representation amenable to importance sampling: rather than inverting the trained networks, we learn to encode them in a more compact embedding that can be mapped to parameters of an analytic BRDF for which importance sampling is known.

Unfortunately, obtaining such a model for every user a priori is challenging, time-consuming, and limits the application scenarios. We propose a novel test-time optimization approach for monocular motion capture that learns a volumetric body model of the user in a self-supervised manner. To this end, our approach combines the advantages of neural radiance fields with an articulated skeleton representation. Our proposed skeleton embedding serves as a common reference that links constraints across time, thereby reducing the number of required camera views from traditionally dozens of calibrated cameras, down to a single uncalibrated one. As a starting point, we employ the output of an off-the-shelf model that predicts the 3D skeleton pose. The volumetric body shape and appearance is then learned from scratch, while jointly refining the initial pose estimate. Our approach is self-supervised and does not require any additional ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape. We demonstrate that our novel combination of a discriminative pose estimation technique with surface-free analysis-by-synthesis outperforms purely discriminative monocular pose estimation approaches and generalizes well to multiple views.",,,,,,ARXIV 2021,

We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation.

Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person specific manner on multi-view data.

Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting.

Previous solutions have sought to explicitly recover the 3D geometry (e.g., as point clouds) or voxel density (e.g., within a pre-defined volume) of the hidden scene. In contrast, inspired by the recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach, we use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent the neural transient field or NeTF. However, NeTF measures the transient over spherical wavefronts rather than the radiance along lines. We therefore formulate a spherical volume NeTF reconstruction pipeline, applicable to both confocal and non-confocal setups. Compared with NeRF, NeTF samples a much sparser set of viewpoints (scanning spots) and the sampling is highly uneven. We thus introduce a Monte Carlo technique to improve the robustness in the reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NeTF provides higher quality reconstruction and preserves fine details largely missing in the state-of-the-art.",,,,,,TPAMI 2021,

Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view dataset named ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments on ZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input, e.g., from a monocular video recording, and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. In particular, we show that even a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, for example a `bullet-time' video effect. Our method disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly to represent scene motion. We also propose a novel rigidity regression network that enables us to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, which leads to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without any explicit supervision. In addition to novel view synthesis, our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, as well as compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration.

Unfortunately, these methods lose all their predictive power once any object in the scene has moved. In this work, we explicitly model rigid motion of objects in the context of neural representations of radiance fields. We show that without any additional human specified supervision, we can reconstruct a dynamic scene with a single rigid object in motion by simultaneously decomposing it into its two constituent parts and encoding each with its own neural representation. We achieve this by jointly optimizing the parameters of two neural radiance fields and a set of rigid poses which align the two fields at each frame. On both synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate that our method can render photorealistic novel views, where novelty is measured on both spatial and temporal axes.

Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation code.

Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution. To generate the continuous representation for images, we train an encoder with LIIF representation via a self-supervised task with super-resolution. The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to x30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided.

This property makes NeRFs hard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangements of objects. Instead of learning a scene radiance field as a NeRF does, we propose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), a representation that models per-object light transport implicitly using a lighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes even when objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetric path tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- and inter-object light transport effects including occlusions, specularities, shadows, and indirect illumination. We evaluate our approach on scene composition and show that it generalizes to novel illumination conditions, producing photorealistic, physically accurate renderings of multi-object scenes.",,,,,,ARXIV 2020,

Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF.

Together, these allow us to render novel views of the object under arbitrary lighting, including indirect illumination effects.

This problem is inherently more challenging when the illumination is not a single light source under laboratory conditions but is instead an unconstrained environmental illumination. Though recent work has shown that implicit representations can be used to model the radiance field of an object, these techniques only enable view synthesis and not relighting. Additionally, evaluating these radiance fields is resource and time-intensive. By decomposing a scene into explicit representations, any rendering framework can be leveraged to generate novel views under any illumination in real-time. NeRD is a method that achieves this decomposition by introducing physically-based rendering to neural radiance fields.

Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoints or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.",,,Direct,,,CVPR 2021,

We take three important steps to equip such a seemingly simple function with adequate expressivity. First, the parameters of the pixel-wise networks are spatially varying so they can represent a broader function class than simple 1x1 convolutions. Second, these parameters are predicted by a fast convolutional network that processes an aggressively low-resolution representation of the input; Third, we augment the input image with a sinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which provides an effective inductive bias for generating realistic novel high-frequency image content.

The existing approach for constructing neural radiance fields involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories. We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset.

Among these applications, neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality: improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly reduced image quality.",,,,,,CVPR 2021,

Our approach has the following favorable properties: (i) It is the first full head morphable model that includes hair. (ii) In contrast to mesh-based models it can be trained on merely rigidly aligned scans, without requiring difficult non-rigid registration. (iii) We design a novel architecture to decouple the shape model into an implicit reference shape and a deformation of this reference shape. With that, dense correspondences between shapes can be learned implicitly.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions.

Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0~dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).",,,,,,CVPR 2021,

Further, only few works consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is that incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a neural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model.

However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

Specifically, we train a neural network to pull query 3D locations to their closest neighbors on the surface using the predicted signed distance values and the gradient at the query locations, both
of which are computed by the network itself. The pulling operation moves each query location with a stride given by the distance predicted by the network. Based on the sign of the distance, this may move the query location along or against the direction of the gradient of the SDF. This is a differentiable operation that allows us to update the signed distance value and the gradient simultaneously during training.

In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.",,,,,,CVPR 2021,

To represent different objects in the environment, we use the distance measurements to train neural network approximations of the signed distance functions incrementally with replay memory. This allows us to formulate a novel robust control barrier safety constraint which takes into account the error in the estimated distance fields and its gradient.

The proposed framework, named eXtended PINNs (XPINNs), further pushes the boundaries of both PINNs as well as conservative PINNs (cPINNs), which is a recently proposed domain decomposition approach in the PINN framework tailored to conservation laws. Compared to PINN, the XPINN method has large representation and parallelization capacity due to the inherent property of deployment of multiple neural networks in the smaller subdomains. Unlike cPINN, XPINN can be extended to any type of PDEs. Moreover, the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space and time), which is not possible in cPINN. Thus, XPINN offers both space and time parallelization, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. In each subdomain, a separate neural network is employed with optimally selected hyperparameters, e.g., depth/width of the network, number and location of residual points, activation function, optimization method, etc. A deep network can be employed in a subdomain with complex solution, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in a subdomain with relatively simple and smooth solutions. We demonstrate the versatility of XPINN by solving both forward and inverse PDE problems, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional problems, from time-dependent to time-independent problems, and from continuous to discontinuous problems, which clearly shows that the XPINN method is promising in many practical problems. The proposed XPINN method is the generalization of PINN and cPINN methods, both in terms of applicability as well as domain decomposition approach, which efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation.

Recent works represent 3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However, neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing (objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data, and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences and the human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only when initialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimization based on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is not differentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Our main contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register a corpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create a self-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network, predicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the human model. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms the corresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose and shape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is not straightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to be on the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is not even defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define the canonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3, which in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cutting the surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion. Second, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map the NN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set. Results demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - following a supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate as additional unlabelled raw scans are processed.

These techniques, however, remain impractical as they still require multi-view annotations of the same object instance during training. As a result, most experimental efforts to date have been limited to synthetic datasets. In this paper, we address this issue and propose SDF-SRN, an approach that requires only a single view of objects at training time, offering greater utility for real-world scenarios. SDF-SRN learns implicit 3D shape representations to handle arbitrary shape topologies that may exist in the datasets.

Recent work, predicts RGB color at every XYZ coordinate forming a texture field, but focus on completing texture given a single 2D image. Instead, we focus on 3D texture and geometry completion from partial and incomplete 3D scans. IF-Nets have recently achieved state-of-the-art results on 3D geometry completion using a multi-scale deep feature encoding, but the outputs lack texture. In this work, we generalize IF-Nets to texture completion from partial textured scans of humans and arbitrary objects. Our key insight is that 3D texture completion benefits from incorporating local and global deep features extracted from both the 3D partial texture and completed geometry. Specifically, given the partial 3D texture and the 3D geometry completed with IF-Nets, our model successfully in-paints the missing texture parts in consistence with the completed geometry.

Many prior works have focused on _latent-encoded_ neural implicits, where a latent vector encoding of a specific shape is also fed as input. While affording latent-space interpolation, this comes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training a specific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit may forgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of a single shape. While previously considered as an intermediary representation for 3D scanning tasks or as a toy-problem leading up to latent-encoding tasks, weight-encoded neural implicits have not yet been taken seriously as a 3D shape representation. In this paper, we establish that weight-encoded neural implicits meet the criteria of a first-class 3D shape representation. We introduce a suite of technical contributions to improve reconstruction accuracy, convergence, and robustness when learning the signed distance field induced by a polygonal mesh -- the _de facto_ standard representation.

Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. There are several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (more than robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to the surface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in a semantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in this direction, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-based implicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we propose an expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient and easy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point in a three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to the surface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, the object, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in a common space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can be modelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field, parameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. We demonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressive representation for human grasp generation. Specifically, our generative model is able to synthesize high-quality human grasps, given only on a 3D object point cloud. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative model compares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of natural human grasps. Our method improves the physical plausibility of the hand-object contact reconstruction and achieves comparable performance for 3D hand reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.",No,,"Direct, Indirect",,,3DV 2020,

We demonstrate that neural reflectance fields can be estimated from images captured with a simple collocated camera-light setup, and accurately model the appearance of real-world scenes with complex geometry and reflectance. Once estimated, they can be used to render photo-realistic images under novel viewpoint and (non-collocated) lighting conditions and accurately reproduce challenging effects like specularities, shadows and occlusions. This allows us to perform high-quality view synthesis and relighting that is significantly better than previous methods.

In this paper, we present a new mid-level patch-based surface representation. At the level of patches, objects across different categories share similarities, which leads to more generalizable models. We then introduce a novel method to learn this patch-based representation in a canonical space, such that it is as object-agnostic as possible. We show that our representation trained on one category of objects from ShapeNet can also well represent detailed shapes from any other category. In addition, it can be trained using much fewer shapes, compared to existing approaches. We show several applications of our new representation, including shape interpolation and partial point cloud completion. Due to explicit control over positions, orientations and scales of patches, our representation is also more controllable compared to object-level representations, which enables us to deform encoded shapes non-rigidly.",,,Direct,,,ECCV 2020,

Recent studies have demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However, existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art (namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene composition.

We subsequently use correspondences to fit the body model to our inner surface and then non-rigidly deform it (under a parametric body + displacement model) to the outer surface in order to capture garment, face and hair detail.

We make these two representations synergistic by introducing novel consistency losses that ensure that the surface created from the atlas aligns with the level-set of the implicit function. Our hybrid architecture outputs results which are superior to the output of the two equivalent single-representation networks, yielding smoother explicit surfaces with more accurate normals, and a more accurate implicit occupancy function.

The approach has similar characteristics to autoencoders, but with a simpler architecture, and is demonstrated in a variational autoencoder equivalent that permits sampling. This also allows implicit representation networks to learn a space of implicit functions without requiring a hypernetwork, retaining their representation advantages across datasets.

Thus, they do not provide precise control over camera viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g., the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images alone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that radiance fields are a powerful representation for generative image synthesis, leading to 3D consistent models that render with high fidelity.",,,,,,NeurIPS 2020,

We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or Sirens, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze Siren activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how Sirens can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations.

To achieve a tight coupling between the two representations, we use a variational objective over a shared latent space. Our two-level model gives rise to a new shape manipulation technique in which a user can interactively manipulate the coarse proxy shape and see the changes instantly mirrored in the high-resolution shape.

Although current approaches have demonstrated the potential in real world settings, they still fail to produce reconstructions with the level of detail often present in the input images. We argue that this limitation stems primarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require large context, but precise predictions require high resolution. Due to memory limitations in current hardware, previous approaches tend to take low resolution images as input to cover large spatial context, and produce less precise (or low resolution) 3D estimates as a result. We address this limitation by formulating a multi-level architecture that is end-to-end trainable. A coarse level observes the whole image at lower resolution and focuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level which estimates highly detailed geometry by observing higher-resolution images. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques on single image human shape reconstruction by fully leveraging 1k-resolution input images.",,,,,,CVPR 2020,

Unlike conventional 3D representations, such as point clouds, which explicitly store scene properties in discrete, localized units, these implicit representations encode a scene in the weights of a neural network which can be queried at any coordinate to produce these same scene properties. Thus far, implicit representations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearance and/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step and demonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) is actually multi-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semantic segmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry. To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learning strategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method is simple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masks in order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation. We explore two novel applications for this semantically aware implicit neural scene representation: 3D novel view and semantic label synthesis given only a single input RGB image or 2D label mask, as well as 3D interpolation of appearance and semantics.",,,,,,3DV 2020,

Here, we propose EikoNet, a deep learning approach to solving the Eikonal equation, which characterizes the first-arrival-time field in heterogeneous 3D velocity structures. Our grid-free approach allows for rapid determination of the travel time between any two points within a continuous 3D domain. These travel time solutions are allowed to violate the differential equation - which casts the problem as one of optimization - with the goal of finding network parameters that minimize the degree to which the equation is violated. In doing so, the method exploits the differentiability of neural networks to calculate the spatial gradients analytically, meaning the network can be trained on its own without ever needing solutions from a finite difference algorithm. EikoNet is rigorously tested on several velocity models and sampling methods to demonstrate robustness and versatility. Training and inference are highly parallelized, making the approach well-suited for GPUs. EikoNet has low memory overhead, and further avoids the need for travel-time lookup tables. The developed approach has important applications to earthquake hypocenter inversion, ray multi-pathing, and tomographic modeling, as well as to other fields beyond seismology where ray tracing is essential.",,,Direct,,,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 2020,

DeepLS replaces the dense volumetric signed distance function (SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with a set of locally learned continuous SDFs defined by a neural network, inspired by recent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-level SDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid of independent latent codes, each responsible for storing information about surfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into local shapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and also enables efficient inference.

In this paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model incorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space.

Processing of such 3D inputs is an increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs, can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data, and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape, we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second, instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape structure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean transformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets clearly outperform prior work in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more accurate 3D human reconstructions.",,Yes,,,,CVPR 2020,

In this paper we offer a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (i.e., point clouds, with or without normal information). We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads to state of the art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details and fidelity compared to previous methods.",,,,,,CVPR 2020,

In this work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shape and texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gained popularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight is that depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicit differentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texture representations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that our single-view reconstructions rival those learned with full 3D supervision.

This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is still limited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which is invaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key factor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit representations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of shape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based representations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle varying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex shapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address the fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference without the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains nontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit surfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision; and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local smoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to be a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose a novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field supervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces, which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D shape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.",,,Direct,,,NeurIPS 2019,

Approaches treating each time step individually lack continuity and exhibit slow inference, while traditional 4D reconstruction methods often utilize a template model or discretize the 4D space at fixed resolution. In this work, we present Occupancy Flow, a novel spatio-temporal representation of time-varying 3D geometry with implicit correspondences. Towards this goal, we learn a temporally and spatially continuous vector field which assigns a motion vector to every point in space and time. In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics. We show that our method can be used for interpolation and reconstruction tasks, and demonstrate the accuracy of the learned correspondences. We believe that Occupancy Flow is a promising new 4D representation which will be useful for a variety of spatio-temporal reconstruction tasks.",,,Direct,,,ICCV 2019,

Mesh-based reconstruction and tracking often fail in these cases, and other approaches (e.g., light field video) typically rely on constrained viewing conditions, which limit interactivity. We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case in point.",,,,,,SIGGRAPH 2019,

We propose Scene Representation Networks (SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that map world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm, SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses, without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process.

Our method consists of two parts: (i) sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions to the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that is constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into a loss function of interest.

A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able to represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep learning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of 3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing unseen 3D models.

While current deep MVS methods achieve impressive results, they crucially rely on ground-truth 3D training data, and acquisition of such precise 3D geometry for supervision is a major hurdle. Our framework instead leverages photometric consistency between multiple views as supervisory signal for learning depth prediction in a wide baseline MVS setup. However, naively applying photo consistency constraints is undesirable due to occlusion and lighting changes across views. To overcome this, we propose a robust loss formulation that: a) enforces first order consistency and b) for each point, selectively enforces consistency with some views, thus implicitly handling occlusions. We demonstrate our ability to learn MVS without 3D supervision using a real dataset, and show that each component of our proposed robust loss results in a significant improvement. We qualitatively observe that our reconstructions are often more complete than the acquired ground truth, further showing the merits of this approach. Lastly, our learned model generalizes to novel settings, and our approach allows adaptation of existing CNNs to datasets without ground-truth 3D by unsupervised finetuning.

These provide trade-offs across fidelity, efficiency and compression capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapes that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion from partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape's surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape's boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classification of space as being part of the shapes interior or not. While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show state-of-the-art performance for learned 3D shape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.",,,,,,CVPR 2019,

In this paper, we aim at making the generation process more structured and easier to interact with. Inspired by vector graphics systems, we propose a new deep image reconstruction paradigm where the outputs are composed from simple layers, defined by their color and a vector transparency mask. This presents a number of advantages compared to the commonly used convolutional network architectures. In particular, our layered decomposition allows simple user interaction, for example to update a given mask, or change the color of a selected layer. From a compact code, our architecture also generates vector images with a virtually infinite resolution, the color at each point in an image being a parametric function of its coordinates. We validate the efficiency of our approach by comparing reconstructions with state-of-the-art baselines given similar memory resources on CelebA and ImageNet datasets. Most importantly, we demonstrate several applications of our new image representation obtained in an unsupervised manner, including editing, vectorization and image search.",,,,Yes (almost done),,ICIP 2020,

However, unlike for images, in 3D there is no canonical representation which is both computationally and memory efficient yet allows for representing high-resolution geometry of arbitrary topology. Many of the state-of-the-art learning-based 3D reconstruction approaches can hence only represent very coarse 3D geometry or are limited to a restricted domain. In this paper, we propose Occupancy Networks, a new representation for learning-based 3D reconstruction methods. Occupancy networks implicitly represent the 3D surface as the continuous decision boundary of a deep neural network classifier. In contrast to existing approaches, our representation encodes a description of the 3D output at infinite resolution without excessive memory footprint. We validate that our representation can efficiently encode 3D structure and can be inferred from various kinds of input. Our experiments demonstrate competitive results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the challenging tasks of 3D reconstruction from single images, noisy point clouds and coarse discrete voxel grids. We believe that occupancy networks will become a useful tool in a wide variety of learning-based 3D tasks.",,,,,,CVPR 2019,

An implicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape can be extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment by means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventional decoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) and shape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks such as generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction, particularly in terms of visual quality.

We propose the use of a deep neural network as a geometric prior for surface reconstruction. Specifically, we overfit a neural network representing a local chart parameterization to part of an input point cloud using the Wasserstein distance as a measure of approximation. By jointly fitting many such networks to overlapping parts of the point cloud, while enforcing a consistency condition, we compute a manifold atlas. By sampling this atlas, we can produce a dense reconstruction of the surface approximating the input cloud. The entire procedure does not require any training data or explicit regularization, yet, we show that it is able to perform remarkably well: not introducing typical overfitting artifacts, and approximating sharp features closely at the same time. We experimentally show that this geometric prior produces good results for both man-made objects containing sharp features and smoother organic objects, as well as noisy inputs. We compare our method with a number of well-known reconstruction methods on a standard surface reconstruction benchmark.",,,,,,CVPR 2019,

A radiance regression function (RRF) represents a non-linear mapping from local and contextual attributes of surface points, such as position, viewing direction, and lighting condition, to their indirect illumination values. The RRF is obtained from precomputed shading samples through regression analysis, which determines a function that best fits the shading data. For a given scene, the shading samples are precomputed by an offline renderer.
 The key idea behind our approach is to exploit the nonlinear coherence of the indirect illumination data to make the RRF both compact and fast to evaluate. We model the RRF as a multilayer acyclic feed-forward neural network, which provides a close functional approximation of the indirect illumination and can be efficiently evaluated at run time. To effectively model scenes with spatially variant material properties, we utilize an augmented set of attributes as input to the neural network RRF to reduce the amount of inference that the network needs to perform. To handle scenes with greater geometric complexity, we partition the input space of the RRF model and represent the subspaces with separate, smaller RRFs that can be evaluated more rapidly. As a result, the RRF model scales well to increasingly complex scene geometry and material variation. Because of its compactness and ease of evaluation, the RRF model enables real-time rendering with full global illumination effects, including changing caustics and multiple-bounce high-frequency glossy interreflections.",,,,,,SIGGRAPH 2018,
