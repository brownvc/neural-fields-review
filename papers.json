[{"UID":"395","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of temporal video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two neighbors. We propose Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) as the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF). NF refers to the recent class of methods for the neural representation of complex 3D scenes that has seen widespread success and application across computer vision. CURE represents the video as a continuous function parameterized by a coordinate-based neural network, whose inputs are the spatiotemporal coordinates and outputs are the corresponding RGB values. CURE introduces a new architecture that conditions the neural network on the input frames for imposing space-time consistency in the synthesized video. This not only improves the final interpolation quality, but also enables CURE to learn a prior across multiple videos. Experimental evaluations show that CURE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video interpolation on several benchmark datasets.","authors":["Wentao Shangguan","Yu Sun","Weijie Gan","Ulugbek S.

First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs are a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive annotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures.","authors":["Dieuwertje Alblas","Christoph Brune","Kak Khee Yeung","Jelmer M.

Each patch is linearly projected into a 1D feature vector and a sequence of transformers process the collection. For positional encoding, we parameterize rays as in a light field representation, with the crucial difference that the coordinates are canonicalized with respect to the target ray, which makes our method independent of the reference frame and improves generalization.

Moreover, the realized latent variables are often hard to interpret. Therefore, many of these methods are often dismissed in the reduced order modeling of dynamical systems governed by the partial differential equations (PDEs).

Inverse rendering is inherently ill-posed because the captured image is an intricate function of unknown lighting conditions, material properties and scene geometry. Recent progress in representing scene properties as coordinate-based neural networks have facilitated neural inverse rendering resulting in impressive geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Our key insight is that polarization is a useful cue for neural inverse rendering as polarization strongly depends on surface normals and is distinct for diffuse and specular reflectance. With the advent of commodity, on-chip, polarization sensors, capturing polarization has become practical. Thus, we propose PANDORA, a polarimetric inverse rendering approach based on implicit neural representations. From multi-view polarization images of an object, PANDORA jointly extracts the object's 3D geometry, separates the outgoing radiance into diffuse and specular and estimates the illumination incident on the object.

Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we propose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen poses and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending weights.

As it is an ill-posed problem, existing methods suffer from low performance for both 3D shape and 6D pose and size estimation in complex multi-object scenarios with occlusions. We present ShAPO, a method for joint multi-object detection, 3D textured reconstruction, 6D object pose and size estimation. Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape, appearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance, which is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel disentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed objects in their respective shape and appearance space. We also propose a novel, octree-based differentiable optimization step, allowing us to further improve object shape, pose and appearance simultaneously under the learned latent space, in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Our novel joint implicit textured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct novel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method, trained on simulated indoor scenes, accurately regresses the shape, appearance and pose of novel objects in the real-world with minimal fine-tuning. Our method significantly out-performs all baselines on the NOCS dataset with an 8% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D pose estimation.

In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON (\"Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals\"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images.

Often, real-world collections of shapes have symmetries, which can be defined as transformations that do not change the essence of the shape. A natural way to incorporate symmetries in shape space learning is to ask that the mapping to the shape space (encoder) and mapping from the shape space (decoder) are equivariant to the relevant symmetries.  In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating equivariance in encoders and decoders by introducing two contributions: (i) adapting the recent Frame Averaging (FA) framework for building generic, efficient, and maximally expressive Equivariant autoencoders; and (ii) constructing autoencoders equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to different parts of the shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully piecewise Euclidean equivariant autoencoder construction. Training our framework is simple: it uses standard reconstruction losses and does not require the introduction of new losses.

We generalize sign agnostic learning (SAL) to include derivatives: given an unsigned distance function to the input raw data, we advocate a novel sign agnostic regression loss, incorporating both pointwise values and gradients of the unsigned distance function. Optimizing this loss leads to a signed implicit function solution, the zero level set of which is a high-quality and valid manifold approximation to the input 3D data. The motivation behind SALD is that incorporating derivatives in a regression loss leads to a lower sample complexity, and consequently better fitting. In addition, we prove that SAL enjoys a minimal length property in 2D, favoring minimal length solutions. More importantly, we are able to show that this property still holds for SALD, i.e., with derivatives included.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of SALD for shape space learning on two challenging datasets: ShapeNet which contains inconsistent orientation and non-manifold meshes, and D-Faust which contains raw 3D scans (triangle soups).

This paper addresses the above three points and uses the outputs of an object-based SLAM system to bound objects in the scene with coarse primitives and - in concert with instance masks - identify obstructions in the training images. Objects are therefore automatically bounded, and non-relevant geometry is excluded from the NeRF representation. The method's performance is benchmarked under ideal conditions and tested against errors in the poses and instance masks.

The high complexity of the unknown non-rigid motion make this task a challenging problem. In this paper, we break down this problem via hierarchical motion decomposition.

Each pyramid level, denoted by a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), takes as input a sinusoidally encoded 3D point and outputs its motion increments from the previous level.

Neural approaches such as NeRF have achieved photorealistic results on novel view synthesis, but they require known camera poses. Solving this problem with unknown camera poses is highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and illumination). We propose a joint optimization framework to estimate the shape, BRDF, and per-image camera pose and illumination. Our method works on in-the-wild online image collections of an object and produces relightable 3D assets for several use-cases such as AR/VR.

In doing so, they loose the direct connection with the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the surface.

Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g. textured meshes, or implicit representations, e.g. radiance fields, and often requires input images with precise camera poses and long processing times for each novel scene.  In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method which processes posed or unposed RGB images of a new area, infers a \"set-latent scene representation\", and synthesises novel views, all in a single feed-forward pass. To calculate the scene representation, we propose a generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene representation to render novel views. Learning is supervised end-to-end by minimizing a novel-view reconstruction error.  We show that this method outperforms recent baselines in terms of PSNR and speed on synthetic datasets, including a new dataset created for the paper.

To this end, we embrace the concept of implicit function and implement a parameterized embodiment with a neural network. Specifically, we first adopt a backbone network to extract spatial features of RGB inputs. Based on it, we devise Spectral Profile Interpolation (SPI) module and Neural Attention Mapping (NAM) module to enrich deep features, where the spatial-spectral correlation is involved for a better representation.

In this paper, we take this idea to its next level: what would it take to perform deep learning on these functions instead, treating them as data? In this context we refer to the data as functa, and propose a framework for deep learning on functa.

The core approach is to render individual rays by querying a neural network at points sampled along the ray to obtain the density and colour of the sampled points, and integrating this information using the rendering equation. Since dense sampling is computationally prohibitive, a common solution is to perform coarse-to-fine sampling.  In this work we address a clear limitation of the vanilla coarse-to-fine approach -- that it is based on a heuristic and not trained end-to-end for the task at hand. We introduce a differentiable module that learns to propose samples and their importance for the fine network, and consider and compare multiple alternatives for its neural architecture. Training the proposal module from scratch can be unstable due to lack of supervision, so an effective pre-training strategy is also put forward.

Brute force approaches carry a quadratic growth in both computational time and memory footprint. While their parallelization is trivial in GPUs, their complexity discourages from using such approaches. Acceleration structures -- such as BVH -- are often applied to increase performance, achieving logarithmic computational times for individual point queries. Nonetheless, their memory footprint also grows rapidly and their parallelization in a GPU is problematic due to their branching nature. We propose using implicit surface representations learnt through deep learning for collision handling in physically based simulations. Our proposed architecture has a complexity of O(n) -- or O(1) for a single point query -- and has no parallelization issues.

Our work suitably exploits the image formation model in a MVPS experimental setup to recover the dense 3D reconstruction of an object from images. We procure the surface orientation using a photometric stereo (PS) image formation model and blend it with a multi-view neural radiance field representation to recover the object's surface geometry. Contrary to the previous multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth contours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then fused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs neural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated by a deep photometric stereo network. We render the MVPS images by considering the object's surface normals for each 3D sample point along the viewing direction rather than explicitly using the density gradient in the volume space via 3D occupancy information. We optimize the proposed neural radiance field representation for the MVPS setup efficiently using a fully connected deep network to recover the 3D geometry of an object. Extensive evaluation on the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark dataset shows that our method performs better than the approaches that perform only PS or only multi-view stereo (MVS) and provides comparable results against the state-of-the-art multi-stage fusion methods.","authors":["Berk Kaya","Suryansh Kumar","Francesco Sarno","Vittorio Ferrari","Luc Van Gool"],"citation":"@article{kaya2022neural,\n    author = {Berk Kaya and Suryansh Kumar and Francesco Sarno and Vittorio Ferrari and Luc Van Gool},\n    title = {Neural Radiance Fields Approach to Deep Multi-View Photometric Stereo},\n    year = {2021},\n    month = {Oct},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05594v1}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"10/11/2021","keywords":["Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05594.pdf","project_link":"https://berk95kaya.github.io/Neural_MVPS_WACV2022/","talk_link":"https://berk95kaya.github.io/Neural_MVPS_WACV2022/","title":"Neural Radiance Fields Approach to Deep Multi-View Photometric Stereo","venue":"WACV","year":"2022"},{"UID":"303","abstract":"Recent history has seen a tremendous growth of work exploring implicit representations of geometry and radiance, popularized through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Such works are fundamentally based on a (implicit) volumetric representation of occupancy, allowing them to model diverse scene structure including translucent objects and atmospheric obscurants. But because the vast majority of real-world scenes are composed of well-defined surfaces, we introduce a surface analog of such implicit models called Neural Reflectance Surfaces (NeRS). NeRS learns a neural shape representation of a closed surface that is diffeomorphic to a sphere, guaranteeing water-tight reconstructions. Even more importantly, surface parameterizations allow NeRS to learn (neural) bidirectional surface reflectance functions (BRDFs) that factorize view-dependent appearance into environmental illumination, diffuse color (albedo), and specular \"shininess.\" Finally, rather than illustrating our results on synthetic scenes or controlled in-the-lab capture, we assemble a novel dataset of multi-view images from online marketplaces for selling goods. Such \"in-the-wild\" multi-view image sets pose a number of challenges, including a small number of views with unknown/rough camera estimates. We demonstrate that surface-based neural reconstructions enable learning from such data, outperforming volumetric neural rendering-based reconstructions. We hope that NeRS serves as a first step toward building scalable, high-quality libraries of real-world shape, materials, and illumination.

The extrinsic embedding ignores known intrinsic manifold properties and is inflexible wrt. transfer of the learned function. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces intrinsic neural fields, a novel and versatile representation for neural fields on manifolds.

The predominant approach is to encourage the network to have a signed distance property. However, this property typically holds only approximately, leading to robustness issues, and holds only at the conclusion of training, inhibiting the use of queries in loss functions. Instead, this work presents a new approach to perform queries directly on general neural implicit functions for a wide range of existing architectures. Our key tool is the application of range analysis to neural networks, using automatic arithmetic rules to bound the output of a network over a region; we conduct a study of range analysis on neural networks, and identify variants of affine arithmetic which are highly effective. We use the resulting bounds to develop geometric queries including ray casting, intersection testing, constructing spatial hierarchies, fast mesh extraction, closest-point evaluation, evaluating bulk properties, and more.

In contrast to the single object scenes against which NeRFs have been traditionally evaluated, this setting poses multiple challenges including (1) the need to incorporate thousands of images with varying lighting conditions, all of which capture only a small subset of the scene, (2) prohibitively high model capacity and ray sampling requirements beyond what can be naively trained on a single GPU, and (3) an arbitrarily large number of possible viewpoints that make it unfeasible to precompute all relevant information beforehand (as real-time NeRF renderers typically do). To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for large-scale scenes, motivating a sparse network structure where parameters are specialized to different regions of the scene. We introduce a simple geometric clustering algorithm that partitions training images (or rather pixels) into different NeRF submodules that can be trained in parallel.

Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference, including intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated data structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this work, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic techniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF), integrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only requiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull, which can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field separation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We provide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF codebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular visual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the highly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering quality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF training from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of a classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can empower and accelerate new NeRF extensions and applications, with its simplicity, portability, and reliable performance gains.

A key challenge is to model the entire morphology and kinematics, without prior knowledge of what aspects of the morphology will be relevant to future tasks.

Traditionally, synthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as rasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations of geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define the actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene representation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene representations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by an artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g., from a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance fields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations using differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse rendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from classical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for synthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap forward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video content. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through hundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable components into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on advances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical rendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred to as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that they are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint synthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static scenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly deforming objects...","authors":["Ayush Tewari","Justus Thies","Ben Mildenhall","Pratul Srinivasan","Edgar Tretschk","Yifan Wang","Christoph Lassner","Vincent Sitzmann","Ricardo Martin-Brualla","Stephen Lombardi","Tomas Simon","Christian Theobalt","Matthias Niessner","Jonathan T.

Manipulating meshes, however, requires one to maintain high quality in the surface discretization. For example, changing the topology of a mesh usually requires additional procedures such as remeshing. This paper instead proposes the use of neural fields for geometry processing. Neural fields can compactly store complicated shapes without spatial discretization. Moreover, neural fields are infinitely differentiable, which allows them to be optimized for objectives that involve higher-order derivatives. This raises the question: can geometry processing be done entirely using neural fields? We introduce loss functions and architectures to show that some of the most challenging geometry processing tasks, such as deformation and filtering, can be done with neural fields. Experimental results show that our methods are on par with the well-established mesh-based methods without committing to a particular surface discretization.

The cumulative rendering process in radiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since gradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object surfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy representations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we directly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training they will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and eventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose Generative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance fields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training convergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the cumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface points as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF combines the merits of two representations in a unified framework. In practice, the training-time transition of start from radiance fields and march to occupancy representations is achieved in GOF by gradually shrinking the sampling region in its rendering process from the entire volume to a minimal neighboring region around the surface. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that GOF can synthesize high-quality images with 3D consistency and simultaneously learn compact and smooth object surfaces.

Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images. Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed approach achieves photorealistic 3D-aware image synthesis while capturing accurate underlying 3D shapes.

Neural approaches such as NeRF have achieved remarkable success in view synthesis, but do not explicitly perform decomposition and instead operate exclusively on radiance (the product of reflectance and illumination). Extensions to NeRF, such as NeRD, can perform decomposition but struggle to accurately recover detailed illumination, thereby significantly limiting realism. We propose a novel reflectance decomposition network that can estimate shape, BRDF, and per-image illumination given a set of object images captured under varying illumination. Our key technique is a novel illumination integration network called Neural-PIL that replaces a costly illumination integral operation in the rendering with a simple network query. In addition, we also learn deep low-dimensional priors on BRDF and illumination representations using novel smooth manifold auto-encoders. Our decompositions can result in considerably better BRDF and light estimates enabling more accurate novel view-synthesis and relighting compared to prior art.

Unlike classical model reduction techniques that build a subspace for a finite number of degrees of freedom, the proposed method approximates the entire deformation map with infinite degrees of freedom.

When testing on real 2D ultrasound images, novel cross-sectional views that are sampled from ImplicitVol show significantly better visual quality than those sampled from existing reconstruction approaches, outperforming them by over 30% (NCC and SSIM), between the output and ground-truth on the 3D volume testing data. The code will be made publicly available.","authors":["Pak-Hei Yeung","Linde Hesse","Moska Aliasi","Monique Haak","the INTERGROWTH-21st Consortium","Weidi Xie","Ana I. L.

Recently, Extended PINNs (XPINNs) based on domain decomposition methods have attracted considerable attention due to their effectiveness in modeling multiscale and multiphysics problems and their parallelization. However, theoretical understanding on their convergence and generalization properties remains unexplored. In this study, we take an initial step towards understanding how and when XPINNs outperform PINNs. Specifically, for general multi-layer PINNs and XPINNs, we first provide a prior generalization bound via the complexity of the target functions in the PDE problem, and a posterior generalization bound via the posterior matrix norms of the networks after optimization. Moreover, based on our bounds, we analyze the conditions under which XPINNs improve generalization. Concretely, our theory shows that the key building block of XPINN, namely the domain decomposition, introduces a tradeoff for generalization. On the one hand, XPINNs decompose the complex PDE solution into several simple parts, which decreases the complexity needed to learn each part and boosts generalization. On the other hand, decomposition leads to less training data being available in each subdomain, and hence such model is typically prone to overfitting and may become less generalizable. Empirically, we choose five PDEs to show when XPINNs perform better than, similar to, or worse than PINNs, hence demonstrating and justifying our new theory.","authors":["Zheyuan Hu","Ameya D.

Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors.

The effectiveness of these techniques is, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of input views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase. Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art 3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric methods when large sets of views are available.","authors":["Eduard Ramon","Gil Triginer","Janna Escur","Albert Pumarola","Jaime Garcia","Xavier Giro-i-Nieto","Francesc Moreno-Noguer"],"citation":"@article{ramon2021h3dnet,\n    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.12512},\n    booktitle = {ArXiv Pre-print},\n    author = {Eduard Ramon and Gil Triginer and Janna Escur and Albert Pumarola and Jaime Garcia and Xavier Giro-i-Nieto and Francesc Moreno-Noguer},\n    title = {H3D-Net: Few-Shot High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12512v1},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {ramon2021h3dnet}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/CrisalixSA/h3ds","data_link":"https://github.com/CrisalixSA/h3ds","date":"7/26/2021","keywords":["Human (Head)","Sparse Reconstruction","Data-Driven Method","Global Conditioning"],"nickname":"H3D-Net","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12512.pdf","project_link":"https://crisalixsa.github.io/h3d-net/","talk_link":"","title":"H3D-Net: Few-Shot High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction","venue":"ARXIV","year":"2021"},{"UID":"223","abstract":"Human portraits exhibit various appearances when observed from different views under different lighting conditions.

Compared to classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their ability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their ability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation problem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have struggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains and/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world application. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue, including the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem as the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this work we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to differential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are inspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the differential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis functions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn these basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains. FBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using separate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of the underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a parallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that FBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems, outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources required, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large, real-world problems.","authors":["Ben Moseley","Andrew Markham","Tarje Nissen-Meyer"],"citation":"@article{moseley2021fbpinns,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07871v1},\n    year = {2021},\n    title = {Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs): a scalable domain decomposition approach for solving differential equations},\n    author = {Ben Moseley and Andrew Markham and Tarje Nissen-Meyer},\n    booktitle = {ArXiv Pre-print},\n    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.07871},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {moseley2021fbpinns}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/benmoseley/FBPINNs","data_link":"","date":"7/16/2021","keywords":["Science & Engineering"],"nickname":"FBPINNs","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07871.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs): a scalable domain decomposition approach for solving differential equations","venue":"ARXIV","year":"2021"},{"UID":"218","abstract":"Classic algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) for computed tomography requires pre-determined weights of the voxels for the projected pixel values to build the equations.

Our key insight is that sparse depth supervision can be used to regularize the learned geometry, a crucial component for effectively rendering novel views using NeRF. We exploit the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ``free\" depth supervision during training: we simply add a loss to ensure that depth rendered along rays that intersect these 3D points is close to the observed depth. We find that DS-NeRF can render more accurate images given fewer training views while training 2-6x faster. With only two training views on real-world images, DS-NeRF significantly outperforms NeRF as well as other sparse-view variants. We show that our loss is compatible with these NeRF models, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal.

A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through this \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\", i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as measured by LPIPS.","authors":["Keunhong Park","Utkarsh Sinha","Peter Hedman","Jonathan T.

So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as Laplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray. Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the two.","authors":["Lior Yariv","Jiatao Gu","Yoni Kasten","Yaron Lipman"],"citation":"@inproceedings{yariv2021volsdf,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12052v1},\n    year = {2021},\n    title = {Volume Rendering of Neural Implicit Surfaces},\n    author = {Lior Yariv and Jiatao Gu and Yoni Kasten and Yaron Lipman},\n    booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)},\n    publisher = {Curran Associates, Inc.},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {yariv2021volsdf}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"6/22/2021","keywords":["Fundamentals","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"VolSDF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12052.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"Volume Rendering of Neural Implicit Surfaces","venue":"NeurIPS","year":"2021"},{"UID":"208","abstract":"In this paper, we aim to create generalizable and controllable neural signed distance fields (SDFs) that represent clothed humans from monocular depth observations. Recent advances in deep learning, especially neural implicit representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars, represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a Hypernetwork/Meta-learning that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The Hypernetwork/Meta-learning is conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes faster.

Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel view synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly complex objects.

However, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned distance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a promising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since the gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate local (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes which are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics. There are additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a low-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such surfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest surface-point CSP representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent complex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also allows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties. We further demonstrate that it leads to efficient implementation of downstream algorithms like sphere-tracing for rendering the 3D surface as well as to create explicit mesh-based representations.

However, the implicit nature of neural implicit representations results in slow inference time and requires careful initialization. In this paper, we revisit the classic yet ubiquitous point cloud representation and introduce a differentiable point-to-mesh layer using a differentiable formulation of Poisson Surface Reconstruction (PSR) that allows for a GPU-accelerated fast solution of the indicator function given an oriented point cloud. The differentiable PSR layer allows us to efficiently and differentiably bridge the explicit 3D point representation with the 3D mesh via the implicit indicator field, enabling end-to-end optimization of surface reconstruction metrics such as Chamfer distance. This duality between points and meshes hence allows us to represent shapes as oriented point clouds, which are explicit, lightweight and expressive. Compared to neural implicit representations, our Shape-As-Points (SAP) model is more interpretable, lightweight, and accelerates inference time by one order of magnitude. Compared to other explicit representations such as points, patches, and meshes, SAP produces topology-agnostic, watertight manifold surfaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAP on the task of surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds and learning-based reconstruction.","authors":["Songyou Peng","Chiyu \"Max\" Jiang","Yiyi Liao","Michael Niemeyer","Marc Pollefeys","Andreas Geiger"],"citation":"@article{peng2021sap,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03452v2},\n    month = {Jun},\n    year = {2021},\n    title = {Shape As Points: A Differentiable Poisson Solver},\n    author = {Songyou Peng and Chiyu \"Max\" Jiang and Yiyi Liao and Michael Niemeyer and Marc Pollefeys and Andreas Geiger},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {peng2021sap}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/autonomousvision/shape_as_points","data_link":"https://github.com/autonomousvision/shape_as_points","date":"6/7/2021","keywords":["Geometry Only","Global Conditioning","Local Conditioning","Voxel Grid","Supervision by Gradient (PDE)","Coarse-to-Fine","Positional Encoding"],"nickname":"SAP","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03452.pdf","project_link":"https://pengsongyou.github.io/sap","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgR0NvYty0A","title":"Shape As Points: A Differentiable Poisson Solver","venue":"NeurIPS","year":"2021"},{"UID":"196","abstract":"Implicit representations of geometry, such as occupancy fields or signed distance fields (SDF), have recently re-gained popularity in encoding 3D solid shape in a functional form. In this work, we introduce medial fields: a field function derived from the medial axis transform (MAT) that makes available information about the underlying 3D geometry that is immediately useful for a number of downstream tasks. In particular, the medial field encodes the local thickness of a 3D shape, and enables O(1) projection of a query point onto the medial axis. To construct the medial field we require nothing but the SDF of the shape itself, thus allowing its straightforward incorporation in any application that relies on signed distance fields. Working in unison with the O(1) surface projection supported by the SDF, the medial field opens the door for an entirely new set of efficient, shape-aware operations on implicit representations. We present three such applications, including a modification to sphere tracing that renders implicit representations with better convergence properties, a fast construction method for memory-efficient rigid-body collision proxies, and an efficient approximation of ambient occlusion that remains stable with respect to viewpoint variations.","authors":["Daniel Rebain","Ke Li","Vincent Sitzmann","Soroosh Yazdani","Kwang Moo Yi","Andrea Tagliasacchi"],"citation":"@article{rebain2021dmf,\n    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.03804},\n    booktitle = {ArXiv Pre-print},\n    author = {Daniel Rebain and Ke Li and Vincent Sitzmann and Soroosh Yazdani and Kwang Moo Yi and Andrea Tagliasacchi},\n    title = {Deep Medial Fields},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03804v1},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {rebain2021dmf}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"6/7/2021","keywords":["Fundamentals","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"DMF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03804.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"Deep Medial Fields","venue":"ARXIV","year":"2021"},{"UID":"195","abstract":"Inferring representations of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental problem of computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity, and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as the Lumigraph.

This enables the rendering of novel views of the object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object's material properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural Radiance Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the object into a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry while solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting. Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, light visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simple smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDF measurements. By explicitly modeling light visibility, NeRFactor is able to separate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadows under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3D models for free-viewpoint relighting in this challenging and underconstrained capture setup for both synthetic and real scenes.

However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixed and limited views, as some clinically useful information is represented only from a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a new concept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from any queried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that an underlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, and directions of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network (Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by using a sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes Electrocardio Panorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to better disentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a new Angular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose a self-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps model the electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very few modifications, Nef-Net can also synthesize ECG signals from scratch. Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panorama synthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG view transformation and ECG synthesis from scratch).

So far, traditional 3D compression methods have focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored. In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress 3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as neural radiance fields.

Compared to traditional representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition, similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters, a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then, hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an order of magnitude.","authors":["Julien N.

To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism.

Previous methods have addressed this issue by running MPC in the task space while relying on a low-level operational space controller for joint control.

This domain decomposition endows cPINNs and XPINNs with several advantages over the vanilla PINNs, such as parallelization capacity, large representation capacity, efficient hyperparameter tuning, and is particularly effective for multi-scale and multi-physics problems. Here, we present a parallel algorithm for cPINNs and XPINNs constructed with a hybrid programming model described by MPI $+$ X, where X $\\in \\{\\text{CPUs},~\\text{GPUs}\\}$. The main advantage of cPINN and XPINN over the more classical data and model parallel approaches is the flexibility of optimizing all hyperparameters of each neural network separately in each subdomain. We compare the performance of distributed cPINNs and XPINNs for various forward problems, using both weak and strong scalings. Our results indicate that for space domain decomposition, cPINNs are more efficient in terms of communication cost but XPINNs provide greater flexibility as they can also handle time-domain decomposition for any differential equations, and can deal with any arbitrarily shaped complex subdomains. To this end, we also present an application of the parallel XPINN method for solving an inverse diffusion problem with variable conductivity on the United States map, using ten regions as subdomains.","authors":["Khemraj Shukla","Ameya D.

Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and results in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses.","authors":["Shaofei Wang","Andreas Geiger","Siyu Tang"],"citation":"@inproceedings{wang2021locally,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    author = {Shaofei Wang and Andreas Geiger and Siyu Tang},\n    title = {Locally Aware Piecewise Transformation Fields for 3D Human Mesh Registration},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08160v1},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {wang2021locally}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/taconite/PTF","data_link":"","date":"4/16/2021","keywords":["Human (Body)","Data-Driven Method","Local Conditioning","Voxel Grid"],"nickname":"","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08160.pdf","project_link":"https://taconite.github.io/PTF/website/PTF.html","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvLoGLVF70k","title":"Locally Aware Piecewise Transformation Fields for 3D Human Mesh Registration","venue":"CVPR","year":"2021"},{"UID":"166","abstract":"We present GANcraft, an unsupervised neural rendering framework for generating photorealistic images of large 3D block worlds such as those created in Minecraft.

In this work, we introduce Stereo Radiance Fields (SRF), a neural view synthesis approach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires only sparse views at test time.

The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the DTU dataset and generalize to new ones without re-training, requiring only 10 sparse and spread-out views as input.

However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy.

We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle consistency in the posed and unposed shapes.

Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited.

In this paper, we introduce Generative Scene Networks (GSN), which learns to decompose scenes into a collection of many local radiance fields that can be rendered from a free moving camera. Our model can be used as a prior to generate new scenes, or to complete a scene given only sparse 2D observations. Recent work has shown that generative models of radiance fields can capture properties such as multi-view consistency and view-dependent lighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing of single objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity of realistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representational capacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to larger and more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learned prior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantly different from observed viewpoints. When compared to existing models, GSN produces quantitatively higher-quality scene renderings across several different scene datasets.","authors":["Terrance DeVries","Miguel Angel Bautista","Nitish Srivastava","Graham W.

While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our world. Several recent works therefore propose generative models which are 3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to the image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporating such a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Current approaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera pose ranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-world data, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our key hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative model which faithfully recovers not only the image but also the camera data distribution.

While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need. In this paper, we advocate considering neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with respect to distortion measures. We show that our formulation enables trivial optimization of rather elusive mapping tasks, such as maps between a collection of surfaces.","authors":["Luca Morreale","Noam Aigerman","Vladimir Kim","Niloy J.

We do so without sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities, we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions. Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input to the neural network.

In this paper, we demonstrate that real-time rendering is possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by three orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.","authors":["Christian Reiser","Songyou Peng","Yiyi Liao","Andreas Geiger"],"citation":"@inproceedings{reiser2021kilonerf,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)},\n    author = {Christian Reiser and Songyou Peng and Yiyi Liao and Andreas Geiger},\n    title = {KiloNeRF: Speeding up Neural Radiance Fields with Thousands of Tiny MLPs},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13744v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {reiser2021kilonerf}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"3/25/2021","keywords":["Speed & Computational Efficiency","Sampling","Voxel Grid","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"KiloNeRF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13744.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"KiloNeRF: Speeding up Neural Radiance Fields with Thousands of Tiny MLPs","venue":"ICCV","year":"2021"},{"UID":"127","abstract":"The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions.

However, one major limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF, our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on available ground truth depth information. Compared to concurrent acceleration methods for raymarching-based neural representations, DONeRF does not require additional memory for explicit caching or acceleration structures, and can render interactively (20 frames per second) on a single GPU.","authors":["Thomas Neff","Pascal Stadlbauer","Mathias Parger","Andreas Kurz","Joerg H.

During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks to fit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape and appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can then render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even real photographs). Finally, the inferred geometric scaffold is itself an accurate estimate of the object's 3D shape. We demonstrate in several experiments the effectiveness of our approach in both synthetic and real images.","authors":["Konstantinos Rematas","Ricardo Martin-Brualla","Vittorio Ferrari"],"citation":"@inproceedings{rematas2021sharf,\n    publisher = {PMLR},\n    booktitle = {International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)},\n    author = {Konstantinos Rematas and Ricardo Martin-Brualla and Vittorio Ferrari},\n    title = {ShaRF: Shape-conditioned Radiance Fields from a Single View},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08860v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {rematas2021sharf}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"2/17/2021","keywords":["Sparse Reconstruction","Generalization","Generative Models","Data-Driven Method","Local Conditioning","Voxel Grid","Sampling"],"nickname":"ShaRF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08860.pdf","project_link":"http://www.krematas.com/sharf/","talk_link":"","title":"ShaRF: Shape-conditioned Radiance Fields from a Single View","venue":"ICML","year":"2021"},{"UID":"114","abstract":"This paper tackles the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from 2D images without known camera poses and intrinsics. Among various NVS techniques, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently gained popularity due to its remarkable synthesis quality. Existing NeRF-based approaches assume that the camera parameters associated with each input image are either directly accessible at training, or can be accurately estimated with conventional techniques based on correspondences, such as Structure-from-Motion. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed NeRF--, for training NeRF models given only RGB images, without pre-computed camera parameters. Specifically, we show that the camera parameters, including both intrinsics and extrinsics, can be automatically discovered via joint optimisation during the training of the NeRF model. On the standard LLFF benchmark, our model achieves comparable novel view synthesis results compared to the baseline trained with COLMAP pre-computed camera parameters. We also conduct extensive analyses to understand the model behaviour under different camera trajectories, and show that in scenarios where COLMAP fails, our model still produces robust results.","authors":["Zirui Wang","Shangzhe Wu","Weidi Xie","Min Chen","Victor Adrian Prisacariu"],"citation":"@article{wang2021nerf--,\n    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07064},\n    booktitle = {ArXiv Pre-print},\n    author = {Zirui Wang and Shangzhe Wu and Weidi Xie and Min Chen and Victor Adrian Prisacariu},\n    title = {NeRF--: Neural Radiance Fields Without Known Camera Parameters},\n    year = {2021},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07064v3},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {wang2021nerf--}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nerfmm","data_link":"","date":"2/14/2021","keywords":["Camera Parameter Estimation"],"nickname":"NeRF\u2212\u2212","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07064.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"NeRF\u2212\u2212: Neural Radiance Fields Without Known Camera Parameters","venue":"ARXIV","year":"2021"},{"UID":"113","abstract":"Controlled capture of real-world material appearance yields tabulated sets of highly realistic reflectance data.

The volumetric body shape and appearance is then learned from scratch, while jointly refining the initial pose estimate. Our approach is self-supervised and does not require any additional ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape.

Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density.

While the visual world is presented in a continuous manner, machines store and see the images in a discrete way with 2D arrays of pixels. In this paper, we seek to learn a continuous representation for images. Inspired by the recent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit neural representation, we propose Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF), which takes an image coordinate and the 2D deep features around the coordinate as inputs, predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate as an output. Since the coordinates are continuous, LIIF can be presented in arbitrary resolution.

The learned continuous representation can be presented in arbitrary resolution even extrapolate to x30 higher resolution, where the training tasks are not provided. We further show that LIIF representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 2D, it naturally supports the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths and significantly outperforms the method with resizing the ground-truths.","authors":["Yinbo Chen","Sifei Liu","Xiaolong Wang"],"citation":"@inproceedings{chen2021liif,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09161v2},\n    year = {2021},\n    title = {Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function},\n    author = {Yinbo Chen and Sifei Liu and Xiaolong Wang},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {chen2021liif}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/yinboc/liif","data_link":"","date":"12/16/2020","keywords":["2D Image Neural Fields","Fundamentals","Data-Driven Method","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"LIIF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09161.pdf","project_link":"https://yinboc.github.io/liif/","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6f2roieSY_8","title":"Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function","venue":"CVPR","year":"2021"},{"UID":"99","abstract":"We present a method for composing photorealistic scenes from captured images of objects.

Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \\emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions.

Further, only few works consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is that incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a neural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model. As evidenced by our experiments, our model is able to disentangle individual objects and allows for translating and rotating them in the scene as well as changing the camera pose.","authors":["Michael Niemeyer","Andreas Geiger"],"citation":"@inproceedings{niemeyer2021giraffe,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12100v2},\n    year = {2021},\n    title = {GIRAFFE: Representing Scenes as Compositional Generative Neural Feature Fields},\n    author = {Michael Niemeyer and Andreas Geiger},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {niemeyer2021giraffe}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"11/24/2020","keywords":["Generative Models","Global Conditioning"],"nickname":"GIRAFFE","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12100.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"GIRAFFE: Representing Scenes as Compositional Generative Neural Feature Fields","venue":"CVPR","year":"2021"},{"UID":"78","abstract":"In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel arrays.

Compared to PINN, the XPINN method has large representation and parallelization capacity due to the inherent property of deployment of multiple neural networks in the smaller subdomains. Unlike cPINN, XPINN can be extended to any type of PDEs. Moreover, the domain can be decomposed in any arbitrary way (in space and time), which is not possible in cPINN. Thus, XPINN offers both space and time parallelization, thereby reducing the training cost more effectively. In each subdomain, a separate neural network is employed with optimally selected hyperparameters, e.g., depth/width of the network, number and location of residual points, activation function, optimization method, etc. A deep network can be employed in a subdomain with complex solution, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in a subdomain with relatively simple and smooth solutions. We demonstrate the versatility of XPINN by solving both forward and inverse PDE problems, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional problems, from time-dependent to time-independent problems, and from continuous to discontinuous problems, which clearly shows that the XPINN method is promising in many practical problems.

In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data, and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences and the human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only when initialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimization based on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is not differentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Our main contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register a corpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create a self-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network, predicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the human model. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms the corresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose and shape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is not straightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to be on the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is not even defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define the canonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3, which in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cutting the surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion. Second, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map the NN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set. Results demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - following a supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate as additional unlabelled raw scans are processed.

Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. There are several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (more than robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to the surface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in a semantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in this direction, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-based implicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we propose an expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient and easy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point in a three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to the surface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, the object, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in a common space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can be modelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field, parameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. We demonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressive representation for human grasp generation. Specifically, our generative model is able to synthesize high-quality human grasps, given only on a 3D object point cloud. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative model compares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of natural human grasps.

We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.","authors":["Ricardo Martin-Brualla","Noha Radwan","Mehdi S.

Since a continuous function is learned, the reconstructions can also be extracted at any arbitrary resolution. However, large datasets such as ShapeNet are required to train such models. In this paper, we present a new mid-level patch-based surface representation. At the level of patches, objects across different categories share similarities, which leads to more generalizable models. We then introduce a novel method to learn this patch-based representation in a canonical space, such that it is as object-agnostic as possible. We show that our representation trained on one category of objects from ShapeNet can also well represent detailed shapes from any other category. In addition, it can be trained using much fewer shapes, compared to existing approaches. We show several applications of our new representation, including shape interpolation and partial point cloud completion. Due to explicit control over positions, orientations and scales of patches, our representation is also more controllable compared to object-level representations, which enables us to deform encoded shapes non-rigidly.","authors":["Edgar Tretschk","Ayush Tewari","Vladislav Golyanik","Michael Zollh\u00f6fer","Carsten Stoll","Christian Theobalt"],"citation":"@inproceedings{tretschk2020patchnets,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)},\n    author = {Edgar Tretschk and Ayush Tewari and Vladislav Golyanik and Michael Zollhofer and Carsten Stoll and Christian Theobalt},\n    title = {PatchNets: Patch-Based Generalizable Deep Implicit 3D Shape Representations},\n    year = {2020},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01639v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {tretschk2020patchnets}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/edgar-tr/patchnets","data_link":"","date":"8/4/2020","keywords":["Human (Body)","Generalization","Data-Driven Method","Global Conditioning","Local Conditioning"],"nickname":"PatchNets","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01639.pdf","project_link":"http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/PatchNets/","talk_link":" http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/PatchNets/data/patchnets_talk.mp4","title":"PatchNets: Patch-Based Generalizable Deep Implicit 3D Shape Representations","venue":"ECCV","year":"2020"},{"UID":"56","abstract":"Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is concerned with synthesizing views under camera viewpoint transformations from one or multiple input images.

Recent studies have demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However, existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art (namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene composition.

We argue that this limitation stems primarily form two conflicting requirements; accurate predictions require large context, but precise predictions require high resolution. Due to memory limitations in current hardware, previous approaches tend to take low resolution images as input to cover large spatial context, and produce less precise (or low resolution) 3D estimates as a result. We address this limitation by formulating a multi-level architecture that is end-to-end trainable. A coarse level observes the whole image at lower resolution and focuses on holistic reasoning. This provides context to an fine level which estimates highly detailed geometry by observing higher-resolution images.

Thus far, implicit representations have primarily been optimized to estimate only the appearance and/or 3D geometry information in a scene. We take the next step and demonstrate that an existing implicit representation (SRNs) is actually multi-modal; it can be further leveraged to perform per-point semantic segmentation while retaining its ability to represent appearance and geometry. To achieve this multi-modal behavior, we utilize a semi-supervised learning strategy atop the existing pre-trained scene representation. Our method is simple, general, and only requires a few tens of labeled 2D segmentation masks in order to achieve dense 3D semantic segmentation.

EikoNet is rigorously tested on several velocity models and sampling methods to demonstrate robustness and versatility. Training and inference are highly parallelized, making the approach well-suited for GPUs. EikoNet has low memory overhead, and further avoids the need for travel-time lookup tables.

In this paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model incorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space.

Processing of such 3D inputs is an increasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are becoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision algorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as they produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations in reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not retained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we propose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs, can handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input data retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but critically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data, and can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two crucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape, we extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which is aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second, instead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep features extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that this forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape structure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean transformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets clearly outperform prior work in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more accurate 3D human reconstructions.","authors":["Julian Chibane","Thiemo Alldieck","Gerard Pons-Moll"],"citation":"@inproceedings{chibane2020ifnet,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    author = {Julian Chibane and Thiemo Alldieck and Gerard Pons-Moll},\n    title = {Implicit Functions in Feature Space for 3D Shape Reconstruction and Completion},\n    year = {2020},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01456v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {chibane2020ifnet}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/jchibane/if-net","data_link":"","date":"3/3/2020","keywords":["Generalization","Data-Driven Method"],"nickname":"IF-Net","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01456.pdf","project_link":"https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ifnets/","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cko07jINRZg","title":"Implicit Functions in Feature Space for 3D Shape Reconstruction and Completion","venue":"CVPR","year":"2020"},{"UID":"30","abstract":"Representing shapes as level sets of neural networks has been recently proved to be useful for different shape analysis and reconstruction tasks.

We observe that a rather simple loss function, encouraging the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient, possesses an implicit geometric regularization property that favors smooth and natural zero level set surfaces, avoiding bad zero-loss solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of this property for the linear case, and show that, in practice, our method leads to state of the art implicit neural representations with higher level-of-details and fidelity compared to previous methods.","authors":["Amos Gropp","Lior Yariv","Niv Haim","Matan Atzmon","Yaron Lipman"],"citation":"@inproceedings{gropp2020igr,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    author = {Amos Gropp and Lior Yariv and Niv Haim and Matan Atzmon and Yaron Lipman},\n    title = {Implicit Geometric Regularization for Learning Shapes},\n    year = {2020},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10099v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {gropp2020igr}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/amosgropp/IGR","data_link":"","date":"2/24/2020","keywords":["Human (Body)","Generalization","Fundamentals"],"nickname":"IGR","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10099.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6cOvBGBQF9g","title":"Implicit Geometric Regularization for Learning Shapes","venue":"CVPR","year":"2020"},{"UID":"29","abstract":"Learning-based 3D reconstruction methods have shown impressive results. However, most methods require 3D supervision which is often hard to obtain for real-world datasets. Recently, several works have proposed differentiable rendering techniques to train reconstruction models from RGB images. Unfortunately, these approaches are currently restricted to voxel- and mesh-based representations, suffering from discretization or low resolution. In this work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shape and texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gained popularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight is that depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicit differentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texture representations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that our single-view reconstructions rival those learned with full 3D supervision. Moreover, we find that our method can be used for multi-view 3D reconstruction, directly resulting in watertight meshes.","authors":["Michael Niemeyer","Lars Mescheder","Michael Oechsle","Andreas Geiger"],"citation":"@inproceedings{niemeyer2020dvr,\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},\n    author = {Michael Niemeyer and Lars Mescheder and Michael Oechsle and Andreas Geiger},\n    title = {Differentiable Volumetric Rendering: Learning Implicit 3D Representations without 3D Supervision},\n    year = {2020},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07372v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {niemeyer2020dvr}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/autonomousvision/differentiable_volumetric_rendering","data_link":"","date":"12/16/2019","keywords":["Global Conditioning"],"nickname":"DVR","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07372.pdf","project_link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_jIN3qWVEw","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_jIN3qWVEw","title":"Differentiable Volumetric Rendering: Learning Implicit 3D Representations without 3D Supervision","venue":"CVPR","year":"2020"},{"UID":"28","abstract":"The goal of this project is to learn a 3D shape representation that enables accurate surface reconstruction, compact storage, efficient computation, consistency for similar shapes, generalization across diverse shape categories, and inference from depth camera observations.

This is particularly interesting since the availability of 3D models is still limited compared to the massive amount of accessible 2D images, which is invaluable for training. The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key factor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit representations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of shape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based representations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle varying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex shapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address the fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference without the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains nontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit surfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision; and (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local smoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to be a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose a novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field supervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces, which provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D shape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.","authors":["Shichen Liu","Shunsuke Saito","Weikai Chen","Hao Li"],"citation":"@inproceedings{liu2019learning,\n    publisher = {Curran Associates, Inc.},\n    booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)},\n    author = {Shichen Liu and Shunsuke Saito and Weikai Chen and Hao Li},\n    title = {Learning to Infer Implicit Surfaces without 3D Supervision},\n    year = {2019},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00767v1},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {liu2019learning}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"11/2/2019","keywords":["Fundamentals","Sampling","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00767.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"Learning to Infer Implicit Surfaces without 3D Supervision","venue":"NeurIPS","year":"2019"},{"UID":"22","abstract":"","authors":[],"citation":"@article{mitchell2022hof,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10388v2},\n    month = {Jul},\n    year = {2019},\n    title = {Higher-Order Function Networks for Learning Composable 3D Object Representations},\n    author = {Eric Mitchell and Selim Engin and Volkan Isler and Daniel D Lee},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {mitchell2022hof}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"10/7/2019","keywords":["Geometry Only","Hypernetwork/Meta-learning"],"nickname":"HOF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10388.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"Higher-Order Function Networks for Learning Composable 3D Object Representations","venue":"ICLR","year":"2022"},{"UID":"21","abstract":"Deep learning based 3D reconstruction techniques have recently achieved impressive results.

We circumvent these difficulties by presenting a learning-based approach to representing dynamic objects inspired by the integral projection model used in tomographic imaging. The approach is supervised directly from 2D images in a multi-view capture setting and does not require explicit reconstruction or tracking of the object. Our method has two primary components: an encoder-decoder network that transforms input images into a 3D volume representation, and a differentiable ray-marching operation that enables end-to-end training. By virtue of its 3D representation, our construction extrapolates better to novel viewpoints compared to screen-space rendering techniques. The encoder-decoder architecture learns a latent representation of a dynamic scene that enables us to produce novel content sequences not seen during training. To overcome memory limitations of voxel-based representations, we learn a dynamic irregular grid structure implemented with a warp field during ray-marching. This structure greatly improves the apparent resolution and reduces grid-like artifacts and jagged motion. Finally, we demonstrate how to incorporate surface-based representations into our volumetric-learning framework for applications where the highest resolution is required, using facial performance capture as a case in point.","authors":["Stephen Lombardi","Tomas Simon","Jason Saragih","Gabriel Schwartz","Andreas Lehrmann","Yaser Sheikh"],"citation":"@article{lombardi2019nv,\n    publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\n    journal = {ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)},\n    author = {Stephen Lombardi and Tomas Simon and Jason Saragih and Gabriel Schwartz and Andreas Lehrmann and Yaser Sheikh},\n    title = {Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images},\n    doi = {10.1145/3306346.3323020},\n    year = {2019},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07751v1},\n    entrytype = {article},\n    id = {lombardi2019nv}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/neuralvolumes","data_link":"","date":"6/18/2019","keywords":["Dynamic/Temporal","Local Conditioning","Voxel Grid","Global Conditioning","Hybrid Geometry Representation"],"nickname":"NV","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07751.pdf","project_link":"https://stephenlombardi.github.io/projects/neuralvolumes/","talk_link":" https://crossminds.ai/video/neural-volumes-learning-dynamic-renderable-volumes-from-images-606f94d175292b321dd0906f/","title":"Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images","venue":"SIGGRAPH","year":"2019"},{"UID":"15","abstract":"Unsupervised learning with generative models has the potential of discovering rich representations of 3D scenes. While geometric deep learning has explored 3D-structure-aware representations of scene geometry, these models typically require explicit 3D supervision. Emerging neural scene representations can be trained only with posed 2D images, but existing methods ignore the three-dimensional structure of scenes. We propose Scene Representation Networks (SRNs), a continuous, 3D-structure-aware scene representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. SRNs represent scenes as continuous functions that map world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm, SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses, without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process. We demonstrate the potential of SRNs by evaluating them for novel view synthesis, few-shot reconstruction, joint shape and appearance interpolation, and unsupervised discovery of a non-rigid face model.","authors":["Vincent Sitzmann","Michael Zollh\u00f6fer","Gordon Wetzstein"],"citation":"@inproceedings{sitzmann2019srn,\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01618v2},\n    year = {2019},\n    title = {Scene Representation Networks: Continuous 3D-Structure-Aware Neural Scene Representations},\n    author = {Vincent Sitzmann and Michael Zollhofer and Gordon Wetzstein},\n    booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)},\n    publisher = {Curran Associates, Inc.},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {sitzmann2019srn}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/vsitzmann/scene-representation-networks","data_link":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OkYgeRcIcLOFu1ft5mRODWNQaPJ0ps90","date":"6/4/2019","keywords":["Generalization","Global Conditioning","Hypernetwork/Meta-learning"],"nickname":"SRN","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01618.pdf","project_link":"https://vsitzmann.github.io/srns/","talk_link":" https://slideslive.com/38922305/scene-representation-networks-continuous-3dstructureaware-neural-scene-representations","title":"Scene Representation Networks: Continuous 3D-Structure-Aware Neural Scene Representations","venue":"NeurIPS","year":"2019"},{"UID":"14","abstract":"The level sets of neural networks represent fundamental properties such as decision boundaries of classifiers and are used to model non-linear manifold data such as curves and surfaces. Thus, methods for controlling the neural level sets could find many applications in machine learning. In this paper we present a simple and scalable approach to directly control level sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i) sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions to the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a sample network that is constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into a loss function of interest. We have tested our method on three different learning tasks: improving generalization to unseen data, training networks robust to adversarial attacks, and curve and surface reconstruction from point clouds. For surface reconstruction, we produce high fidelity surfaces directly from raw 3D point clouds. When training small to medium networks to be robust to adversarial attacks we obtain robust accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Matan Atzmon","Niv Haim","Lior Yariv","Ofer Israelov","Haggai Maron","Yaron Lipman"],"citation":"@inproceedings{atzmon2019controlling,\n    publisher = {Curran Associates, Inc.},\n    booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)},\n    author = {Matan Atzmon and Niv Haim and Lior Yariv and Ofer Israelov and Haggai Maron and Yaron Lipman},\n    title = {Controlling Neural Level Sets},\n    year = {2019},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11911v2},\n    entrytype = {inproceedings},\n    id = {atzmon2019controlling}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de/","date":"5/28/2019","keywords":["Generalization","Fundamentals","Sampling"],"nickname":"","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11911.pdf","project_link":"https://github.com/matanatz/ControllingNeuralLevelsets","talk_link":"","title":"Controlling Neural Level Sets","venue":"NeurIPS","year":"2019"},{"UID":"13","abstract":"Reconstructing 3D shapes from single-view images has been a long-standing research problem.

At the same time, generative models were proposed that can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups. A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object. We show that Texture Fields are able to represent high frequency texture and naturally blend with modern deep learning techniques. Experimentally, we find that Texture Fields compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for conditional texture reconstruction of 3D objects and enable learning of probabilistic generative models for texturing unseen 3D models.

While current deep MVS methods achieve impressive results, they crucially rely on ground-truth 3D training data, and acquisition of such precise 3D geometry for supervision is a major hurdle. Our framework instead leverages photometric consistency between multiple views as supervisory signal for learning depth prediction in a wide baseline MVS setup. However, naively applying photo consistency constraints is undesirable due to occlusion and lighting changes across views. To overcome this, we propose a robust loss formulation that: a) enforces first order consistency and b) for each point, selectively enforces consistency with some views, thus implicitly handling occlusions. We demonstrate our ability to learn MVS without 3D supervision using a real dataset, and show that each component of our proposed robust loss results in a significant improvement. We qualitatively observe that our reconstructions are often more complete than the acquired ground truth, further showing the merits of this approach. Lastly, our learned model generalizes to novel settings, and our approach allows adaptation of existing CNNs to datasets without ground-truth 3D by unsupervised finetuning.

While classical SDF's both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes.

A radiance regression function (RRF) represents a non-linear mapping from local and contextual attributes of surface points, such as position, viewing direction, and lighting condition, to their indirect illumination values. The RRF is obtained from precomputed shading samples through regression analysis, which determines a function that best fits the shading data. For a given scene, the shading samples are precomputed by an offline renderer.\n The key idea behind our approach is to exploit the nonlinear coherence of the indirect illumination data to make the RRF both compact and fast to evaluate. We model the RRF as a multilayer acyclic feed-forward neural network, which provides a close functional approximation of the indirect illumination and can be efficiently evaluated at run time. To effectively model scenes with spatially variant material properties, we utilize an augmented set of attributes as input to the neural network RRF to reduce the amount of inference that the network needs to perform. To handle scenes with greater geometric complexity, we partition the input space of the RRF model and represent the subspaces with separate, smaller RRFs that can be evaluated more rapidly. As a result, the RRF model scales well to increasingly complex scene geometry and material variation. Because of its compactness and ease of evaluation, the RRF model enables real-time rendering with full global illumination effects, including changing caustics and multiple-bounce high-frequency glossy interreflections.","authors":["Peiran Ren","Jiaping Wang","Minmin Gong","Stephen Lin","Xin Tong","Baining Guo"],"citation":"@article{ren2013global,\n    author = {Peiran Ren and Jiaping Wang and Minmin Gong and Stephen Lin and Xin Tong and Baining Guo},\n    title = {Global Illumination with Radiance Regression Functions},\n    year = {2013},\n    date = {July 2013},\n    publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\n    address = {New York, NY, USA},\n    volume = {32},\n    number = {4},\n    issn = {0730-0301},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/2461912.2462009},\n    doi = {10.1145/2461912.2462009},\n    journal = {ACM Trans.

The results show that neural network is a promising approach for reconstruction and representation of 3D objects.","authors":["Lim Wen Peng","Siti Mariyam Shamsuddin"],"citation":"@book{lim20043d,\n    title = {3D Object Reconstruction and Representation Using Neural Networks},\n    author = {Wen Peng Lim and Siti Mariyam Shamsuddin},\n    year = {2004},\n    publisher = {Universiti Teknologi Malaysia},\n    booktitle = {International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Australasia and South East Asia},\n    entrytype = {book},\n    id = {lim20043d}\n}","code_link":"","data_link":"","date":"6/15/2004","keywords":["Fundamentals"],"nickname":"","pdf_url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.101.6810&rep=rep1&type=pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"","title":"3D Object Reconstruction and Representation Using Neural Networks","venue":"GRAPHITE","year":"2004"},{"UID":"0","abstract":"We present a new representation for the storage and reconstruction of arbitrary reflectance functions.

By leveraging the recent implicit neural representation techniques, particularly the appealing neural radiance fields, we introduce an object field component to learn unique codes for all individual objects in 3D space only from 2D supervision. The key to this component is a series of carefully designed loss functions to enable every 3D point, especially in non-occupied space, to be effectively optimized even without 3D labels. In addition, we introduce an inverse query algorithm to freely manipulate any specified 3D object shape in the learned scene representation. Notably, our manipulation algorithm can explicitly tackle key issues such as object collisions and visual occlusions. Our method, called DM-NeRF, is among the first to simultaneously reconstruct, decompose, manipulate and render complex 3D scenes in a single pipeline. Extensive experiments on three datasets clearly show that our method can accurately decompose all 3D objects from 2D views, allowing any interested object to be freely manipulated in 3D space such as translation, rotation, size adjustment, and deformation.","authors":["Bing Wang","Lu Chen","Bo Yang"],"citation":"  @article{wang2022dmnerf,\n  title={DM-NeRF: 3D Scene Geometry Decomposition and Manipulation from 2D Images},\n  author={Bing, Wang and Chen, Lu and Yang, Bo},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.07227},\n  year={2022}\n}","code_link":"https://github.com/vLAR-group/DM-NeRF","data_link":"","date":"8/15/2022","keywords":["Editable","Image-Based Rendering"],"nickname":"DM-NeRF","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07227.pdf","project_link":"","talk_link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iE0RwmdLIzk","title":"DM-NeRF: 3D Scene Geometry Decomposition and Manipulation from 2D Images","venue":"ARXIV","year":"2022"}]
